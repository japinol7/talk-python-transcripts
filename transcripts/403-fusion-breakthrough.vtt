00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060
Imagine a world with free and unlimited clean energy.


00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.780
That's the musings of a great science fiction story,


00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.620
isn't it?


00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.340
But nuclear fusion, the kind that powers the sun,


00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.060
has always been close at hand.


00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.060
We see the sun every day,


00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.380
and yet impossibly far away as a technology.


00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.460
However, we took a major step


00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.100
towards this becoming a reality


00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.500
when the folks at the Lawrence Livermore


00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.300
National Laboratory in the US achieved ignition,


00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.340
where they got significantly more energy out


00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.500
than they put in.


00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.980
and Python played a major role


00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.880
in this research and experiment.


00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.140
We have Jay Salmonson here to give us a look


00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.420
at the science and the Python code of this discovery.


00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.580
Also, I've linked a five minute YouTube video


00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.020
explaining the details


00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.580
and showing this massive machine that they used.


00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.260
It's worth watching before you listen further.


00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.380

Jay, welcome to Talk Python to Me.


00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.040
- Thanks for having me, Michael.


00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.880
Pleasure to be here.


00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.360
- It's a pleasure to have you.


00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.600
Congratulations.


00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.600
- Thanks, thanks.


00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.000
And of course, I would be remiss if I didn't


00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.960
totally qualify that this,


00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.760
and he congrats have to be accepted on behalf of hundreds of people at the NIF,


00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.360
at the laboratory and laboratories and industry around,


00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.960
and indeed extending back six decades of research that went into this.


00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.520
My part is insignificant but not negligible.


00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.920
>> I'm having a couple of my mental models broken recently.


00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.400
For me, fusion has always been one of those things that's always 30 years out.


00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.600
It's like, we know it's possible,


00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.340
but it's just, we're really barely scratching the surface.


00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.840
And the other mental model is AI


00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.520
is always 30 years out as well.


00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.360
And this year of ChatGPT and stable diffusion


00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.320
and all those things.


00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.160
- Things are changing.


00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.920
- Yeah, and this huge breakthrough that you all had.


00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.560
I'm sure there's still work to be done.


00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.880
You're not there yet, right?


00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.560
We're not all driving around little tiny,


00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.360
you know, water powered cars and stuff,


00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.160
but it shows that it's possible, right?


00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.240
And that it's a massive deal.


00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.400
- Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.


00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.240
there are a couple of big changes here in the last months even, right?


00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.440
So I'm still processing both of those actually.


00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.320
So yeah, it's going to be an interesting world.


00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.720
I think as far as ignition,


00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.840
it is still a long path forward towards utilization. We can talk about that.


00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.980
>> Yeah, we will. But it's so exciting because with renewables, that's great.


00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.660
But there's always a cost to that in terms of like,


00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.680
well, just think solar panels,


00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.580
the mountains of e-waste of those things as they deteriorate over time or just getting them all produced.


00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.640
But I think this is different and I'm super excited to be diving into it with you.


00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.640
I'm also really interested to hear how Python played an interesting role in it.


00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.340
>> Yeah, I think that's a fun story and so I'm happy to have a chance to share it.


00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.240
>> Yeah, and you've been central to it, which is fantastic.


00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.440
Now, before we get into all that,


00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.780
let's get into your story.


00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.820
How'd you get into, I guess, physics as well as Python?


00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.100
>> Yeah. I always wanted to be a scientist growing up.


00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.580
As a little kid, it was always space and dinosaurs and dinosaurs and space and all.


00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.020
That's how it started.


00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.580
Then I remembered, it's actually just about this time,


00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.300
about 40 years ago or so,


00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.180
my dad brought home a Commodore 64.


00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.620
This would have been the after Christmas buzz of learning basic and stuff,


00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.540
my sister and I. That really started my computational journey.


00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.740
And then fast forwarding to I got a degree in physics


00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.380
from Montana State University,


00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.340
did a cosmology with Bill Hiscock there,


00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.780
and then moved to California, took some time off.


00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.940
I worked at Chevron in the geophysics staff


00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.500
for a couple years, met my wife there,


00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.640
worked at NASA Ames Research Center


00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.380
in Mountain View for a year.


00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.260
Then I decided to go back to school,


00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.020
which is what I always wanted to do.


00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.700
I looked around, I didn't really wanna move very much.


00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.500
I was in the East Bay and San Francisco Bay Area.


00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.820
- It's nice there.


00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:06.660
- It is nice there.


00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.520
- You have a family as well, right?


00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.060
Which makes it, that can also always be a tricky balance.


00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.400
- Yeah, exactly, exactly.


00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.880
That's always a constraint.


00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.900
And ultimately, that's a fairly stupid reason


00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.620
to make decisions, but it actually worked out very well


00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.980
'cause it made me look around,


00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.960
and it turned out there was this amazing graduate program


00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.740
at this place called Morris Livermore National Laboratory,


00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.600
run through the UC Davis, University of California Davis,


00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.160
called the Department of Applied Science.


00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.000
And so I ended up going there for five years for a PhD


00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.480
and studied gamma ray bursts,


00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.880
the largest explosions in the universe


00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.280
that come across the universe.


00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.240
They send their high energy radiation


00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.840
from these giant relativistic mysterious explosions.


00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.960
It's very exciting.


00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.280
I worked on modeling, doing numerical modeling


00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.560
of neutron stars in their last few orbits


00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.560
and few milliseconds before they coalesce


00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.760
as the default model for gamma ray bursts at the time.


00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.880
But it was a great experience programming in C++


00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.320
and doing general relativity and such.


00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.080
Then I did a postdoc after that and I got involved with another code at the lab that's


00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.140
actually people who are interested in numerical astrophysics might look into.


00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.480
It's called Cosmos++ with Peter Aninos and Chris Fregeel at College of Charleston.


00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.440
Again C++ doing more gamma ray burst research and such.


00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.240
That's what I did until about 20 years ago when I took a job at Ignition with the ICF


00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.480
campaign, the inertial confinement fusion campaign.


00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.480
That's where I've basically been ever since.


00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.640
When things sort of switched gears, I basically kind of, I still worked with Cosmos++ for


00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.820
a few years part-time, but really I kind of retired my compiled efforts and went more


00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.700
towards the interpreted world and got more involved in that.


00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.300
Because then in ICF, the whole point was NIF was being built.


00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.580
It was still a hole in the ground at the time.


00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.240
And there are these big multi-physics codes.


00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.060
That's what we use at the lab to kind of research our ideas, to run them in simulations, see


00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.260
what they'll do.


00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.300
And we use interpreted languages to interface with those, either to run the code to help


00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.840
steer it, if you will, but also to post-process.


00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.240
And so I got really involved with a few languages.


00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.080
And Python didn't actually come to the fore at first.


00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.600
I was introduced with Python a little bit in the '90s.


00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.200
I wrote a little cron job that went to the weather service and put a weather map of my


00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.580
background every hour, which I thought was pretty nifty.


00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.680
And so I saw that it had potential.


00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.160
But one of the languages that I was first introduced to was Yorick, which was actually


00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.200
written by a physicist at Livermore, Dave Monroe, and so it's fairly extensively used


00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.200
at the lab.


00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:40.600
And it actually is, it has a causal connection to particularly the NumPy library in Python.


00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.800
I also actually got pretty involved in Perl at the time.


00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.200
Something about it sort of appealed to me.


00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.600
I sort of liked its lexical structure.


00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.760
Larry Wall is a linguist and all.


00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.840
But definitely for the last 10 years or so, the weak couplings that are appealing about


00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.800
Python just kept coming back.


00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:00.240
So I've since bitten down on that hook and drank Kool-Aid pretty readily.


00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.200
So for the last 10 years or so,


00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.360
it's been all Python all the time.


00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.520
>> Nice.


00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.320
>> Yeah.


00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:09.760
>> Now you just got to tattoo the Python logo and it's no going back.


00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.680
>> Exactly.


00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.880
>> Got it.


00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.640
>> You have one, right?


00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.000
>> That's right. I keep my whole back.


00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.080
>> Yeah. Right.


00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.320
>> One thing that stands out with that story,


00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.560
which is really interesting,


00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:26.020
I think it seems to me like there's quite a move in the sciences in general to move


00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.060
more towards open source and more towards sharing in terms of,


00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:31.820
"Hey, if you use this library and we use that library,


00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.820
then maybe we can both have a better library type of sharing."


00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.340
>> Yeah.


00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.300
>> Than they traditionally been.


00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:39.740
>> Absolutely. That's something that I've been


00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:43.540
fortunate enough to watch happen over the course of these years.


00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:47.860
I think what we see that it's non-linear, it's just exploding.


00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.300
I think one of the appeals of Python has been PyPI


00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.300
and just this proliferation of packages.


00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.940
I mean, shout out your Python Bytes podcast.


00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.980
I find that to be quite fun and almost


00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.060
overwhelming the new things that are coming out all the time.


00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.820
You got to keep up and pick and choose,


00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.940
but there's all sorts of new things.


00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:11.020
The paradigm has shifted for me and I think a lot of people,


00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.260
where I have this thing to do,


00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.420
I better start doing that or crack a book or whatever.


00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.540
But no, it's like, let's find the package that already does that.


00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.980
And that's just a fundamental shift.


00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.060
And it's actually a lot of fun, I think.


00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.980
And you can contribute to it as well.


00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:26.980
Yeah, absolutely.


00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.820
I feel like when I went to school, I just took one or two, just maybe one or two.


00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.980
I certainly won maybe two computer science type classes.


00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:39.180
And it was all about algorithms and, and how can you evaluate, oh, this


00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.700
bubble sort versus that, or this data structure versus that.


00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.380
And it seems a lot less, not that that's relevant, but it seems way more


00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.540
important now to, oh, I can evaluate these libraries and pick this library.


00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.240
And it probably does something great inside, but I don't need to worry about it.


00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.400
Right.


00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.880
It's more building with Lego blocks that it is, you know, building with wiring


00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.720
kits, I don't know, like, you know, it's more big pieces that you just put together.


00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.820
And, you know, kind of just to tie in, you know, the very first


00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.180
inklings of what ChatGPT and, and, you know, and copilot and stuff can bring.


00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.720
I mean, you know, I think Andrej Karpathy made the comment that the new


00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:15.940
interpreted language is English, right?


00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:19.160
And it's almost getting to that point where we can just almost dictate what we


00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.700
want, you know, which is sort of the next level of abstraction, you know, I think


00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.360
that's just going to happen now, right?


00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:24.680
Yeah.


00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.760
It's we're past the 30 years, I guess.


00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.040
And it's starting to get crazy.


00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:33.160
So I think this is really a positive move for the sciences in general, that so many


00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.240
of these libraries are available and now you have thousands or millions of people


00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.240
working on it and using it, not just a single research lab.


00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.340
>> Yeah. It's nice to actually see,


00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.240
I think from my little vantage point,


00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.660
I'm not always aware of it,


00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.260
but the lab Livermore, for instance,


00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:49.980
and I think all the labs participate,


00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:53.460
they release a wealth of open-source software as well.


00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.380
It tends to be fairly focused on high-performance computing.


00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.080
It has a niche, but it's definitely,


00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.060
we're trying to give back and be part of that conversation.


00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.140
>> This portion of Talk Python to me is brought to you


00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:13.180
by Taipy. Taipy is the next generation open source Python application builder. With Taipy,


00:11:13.180 --> 00:11:18.600
you can turn data and AI algorithms into full web apps in no time. Here's how it works.


00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.300
You start with a bare algorithm written in Python. You then use Taipy's innovative tool


00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:28.780
set that enables Python developers to build interactive end user applications quickly.


00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.940
There's a visual designer to develop highly interactive GUIs ready for production. And


00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:37.940
for inbound data streams, you can program against the Type I core layer as well.


00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.100
Type I core provides intelligent pipeline management, data caching, and scenario and


00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.100
cycle management facilities.


00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.100
That's it.


00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.380
You'll have transformed a bare algorithm into a full-fledged decision support system for


00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.380
end users.


00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.100
Type I is pure Python and open source, and you install it with a simple pip install type


00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.100
I.


00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.140
For large organizations that need fine-grained control and authorization around their data,


00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:02.740
there is a paid Type I Enterprise Edition.


00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.720
the Type I core and GUI described above is completely free to use. Learn more and get


00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:15.220
started by visiting talkpython.fm/typy. That's T-A-I-P-Y. The links in your show notes. Thank


00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.060
you to Type I for sponsoring the show.


00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:24.100
Well, let's start our conversation and our exploration here with some science and then


00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:29.700
we'll get back down to the Python inside of it. Yeah. Let's talk about just all the stuff


00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:35.020
this led up to fusion in general and then the science and the attempts that have led


00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.580
up to this great breakthrough?


00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:42.700
Yeah, so like I mentioned, actually, you know, laser-induced fusion has been a research area


00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.820
for six decades at the lab.


00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:49.620
When the first ideas were starting, when the first lasers were around and the first people


00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.820
started thinking about that as a driver for fusion.


00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.220
And again, this concept of fusion is inertial confinement fusion.


00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:01.340
sort of based on the concept of taking some hydrogen, hydrogen isotopes, we tend to use


00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:05.860
deuterium and tritium, those are the heavier versions of hydrogen because they have a higher


00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:11.500
cross-section for fusion reacting. And we implode them, so yes, you have a diagram here


00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:17.420
that you're showing. So we have a capsule, rather than that distinct from magnetic fusion,


00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:21.780
which is sort of the other camp where it's a little bit more like the fluorescent bulb


00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:26.180
model for fusion where you're running plasma through a torus or some sort of a manifold


00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:31.300
like that, making it very hot but at low density and maybe something a little more akin to


00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:36.080
the corona of the sun, say, and fusion will happen there in those schemes.


00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:40.700
And then here we're actually taking all of the fuel and putting it inside of one little


00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:46.420
capsule and then we're compressing that capsule, getting it to very dense as opposed to fusion


00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.660
or magnetic fusion, which is low density, very dense and hot conditions where fusion


00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:56.260
can transpire. It's actually sort of analogous, I think, to an internal combustion engine


00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.460
in that regard. So we're actually, you know, driving fusion. It happens and it blows itself


00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.460
apart.


00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:07.300
Okay. The graphics that I had seen largely were those big Taurus-like structures. Was


00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:09.820
it? There's a name for that, the T.


00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.340
Well, there's Tokamaks and Spherimaks. Yeah, there's several concepts out there.


00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.520
Right. That's the one. So those I think is probably, yeah, that's probably what a lot


00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.700
of people are familiar with.


00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:24.060
And this project is focused on aiming a bunch of lasers at a really small point


00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.300
and just really compressing it and heating it all all at once.


00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:28.580
Right.


00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.260
Exactly.


00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.280
So, you know, just to kind of, I guess, give the outline is just like you said.


00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.660
So the NIF is a big, big stadium size facility at the Northeast corner of


00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.260
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.


00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.500
And in it, it is filled with 192 gigantic beams.


00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:47.740
each one of them is basically one of the largest laser facilities in the world, and there are


00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:54.620
192 of them. They each basically work in concert to shine a pulse of just a few nanoseconds


00:14:54.620 --> 00:15:00.380
long, and this pulse goes down, and kind of as the graphic you showed, they all are basically


00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:05.040
trying to converge at a point. But rather than just a point, what we put at the center


00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.180
of this convergence of all these 192 beams is a little tiny gold can, and so the can


00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.940
is about a centimeter high and maybe half a centimeter wide.


00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.620
And on the top and bottom, you put these two little holes and the no


00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.600
enclosure, the laser entrance holes that LEH is so, and so it's rather


00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.560
amazing, these 192 beams of, of, you know, gigantic lasers and when they're,


00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.200
when they're being amplified, they're actually several feet across.


00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.420
So the beams are spread out.


00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.200
They're huge, but they all get focused down to the point where they can all


00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:39.260
go through just a couple of millimeter sized hole, both at the top and the


00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.960
bottom of this gold can and they shine into the can and they shine on the


00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.120
inside wall of the can and their goal is then to heat the can, right?


00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.360
So you start with this laser light and then you want to heat this can and this


00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.320
can we, we refer to it as a whole room.


00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.180
That's a German word that refers roughly, translates roughly to hollow room.


00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:00.400
And that's just simply because it's something that holds, you know, holds


00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.240
the heat and all rooms are actually.


00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:04.020
Everywhere in our life, right?


00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:07.720
Our ovens are a whole room, whole ovens, heat up to temperatures


00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.440
of our infrared temperatures, right?


00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.840
We can sort of feel that heat.


00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:13.280
We can't see it, but we can feel it.


00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.200
You know, if you get up, we heat these little hole rooms up


00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.040
to actually x-ray temperatures so that they're so hot,


00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.040
they're beyond visual, they're beyond ultraviolet,


00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.040
but into the x-rays, and it's actually a fraction


00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:27.440
of the temperature at the center of the sun, in fact.


00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.400
And so we're actually bathing this little tiny gold can


00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:34.520
within this superheated x-ray environment.


00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:39.320
And then we inserted inside of that horn beforehand, a hapless little capsule.


00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:44.840
And this capsule is about exactly, you know, you kind of feel sorry for it.


00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.800
Yeah.


00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.320
Anthropomorphize it a little bit, but, and, and this capsule is, is made of,


00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.720
it's a very, very thin shell, just a couple hundred microns or a


00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.680
hundred or so microns, thick.


00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.240
And, right now that these shots are being actually there, they're


00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.720
used a nano, nano crystalline diamond.


00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.080
So they're like pure carbon.


00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:05.360
shelves and so they're very dense.


00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.860
And so it's, it's kind of funny.


00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:09.700
We have a gold whore on the whore room is made out of gold and the


00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.160
capsule is made out of diamond, right?


00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.340
And so could you have picked more prosaic ingredients, but


00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.280
these are the ones that work.


00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.960
And so the point of this capsule is really just, it's, it


00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.540
acts like a rocket fuel.


00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.180
And so what happens is the laser energy is absorbed into that


00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.020
diamond and it explodes.


00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.780
It's just does pretty much exactly what you'd kind of think.


00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.880
It just, it heats and explodes.


00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.440
And then, you know, going back to your Newton's third law, right?


00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.680
So if you have an action for a reaction, there has to be an equal and opposite


00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.320
reaction.


00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.440
If you have this little capsule exploding outward, right in this bath of x-rays,


00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.880
whatever you put inside of that capsule has to go inward.


00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:52.680
And happily we were really, we actually put in a little bit of deuterium


00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.400
and tritium and we actually froze it into an ice layer around the inside of that


00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:56.880
capsule.


00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.480
So that becomes our payload.


00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.640
So it's the spirit.


00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.920
Spherical rocket analogy is actually very apt.


00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:08.420
So you're actually, you're having this fuel blowing outward and causing thrust that pushes the payload inward,


00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:13.620
and you try to compress it into a tiny little pellet, again, trying to achieve very, very high densities,


00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.020
hundreds of grams per cubic centimeter and tens of kilovolts.


00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.020
That's no enclature, we can talk more about that.


00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.820
But to get to the point where you're actually at fusion conditions,


00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:28.820
and what you're looking for and the goal, the reason why we're talking right now is you're always,


00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.320
the goal was always to achieve an ignition.


00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:36.200
So for a very long time, people have been demonstrated that you can get neutrons out of this.


00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:43.440
You can actually get a few of the billions or well, billions of billions of hydrogen atoms in there to fuse.


00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.280
But what we're trying to do is get to the point where they bootstrap,


00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:51.640
where one fusion can cause another fusion or several more fusions, which will cause more fusions.


00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.680
And you get what's called an ignition and it's ignition wave where actually the fusions will cause more fusions


00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.680
and they'll actually cause a burn propagating from the tiny center of that


00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.920
little assembled piece of fuel, move outward and actually, you know,


00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.000
propagate and burn fuel as it goes out.


00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.600
And that way you can actually, you know, that's that way you, you get a


00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:14.320
macroscopic amount of the fuel to burn, to convert to helium and release


00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.160
fusion energy, release neutrons.


00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.840
And that's, that's what we finally achieved.


00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.560
It's extremely difficult because basically everything has to work perfectly.


00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:27.600
in 192 lasers and probably a chaotic dynamic reaction


00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.140
of some form of explosion and interaction there.


00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.680
It's not super easy to control


00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.920
and there's some interesting Python planning,


00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.760
some of those experiments and stuff.


00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.560
But it sounds to me that it's,


00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.160
even though it's in a sense very much the opposite


00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:45.080
of fission, traditional nuclear reactions


00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:46.480
that we already leverage,


00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.960
the way that it kind of propagates


00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.880
and once you get it going,


00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.880
it sounds actually oddly similar.


00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:55.200
Yeah, I mean, fission, the good thing about it is, or the nice thing about it is that


00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:01.120
it's passive, right? But it does operate on that same idea. If you put fission products


00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.880
really close together and one goes off, then it might cause others to go off and you can


00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:09.840
get that chain reaction. And exactly, we're trying to get that to happen with fusion.


00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.240
But the thing is that, you know, fusion, these particles are so light and they're all like


00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.320
charges, right? So they're all trying to push each other away. And as soon as you start putting


00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:22.560
heat into it, the product of fusion, the thing you wanted to get out of it, it


00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.720
immediately blows itself apart and turns itself off.


00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.120
Unlike fission, that's really kind of always the trick.


00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:29.880
That's the hard part.


00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:30.160
Yeah.


00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.080
Yeah, exactly.


00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:36.200
You have to really carefully balance the lasers to, to keep the confinement


00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.400
happening and keep the pressure there until it takes off, right?


00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.000
The lasers are short shrift.


00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.880
Unfortunately, there's, they're just amazing technological achievements, frankly.


00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.640
And I'm, I'm only just, you know, I know a little bit about them.


00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.800
I know enough about them to simulate them.


00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.960
But they're amazing technological achievements


00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.080
that you can get all of these to run together.


00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.000
What they do is actually they give this blast,


00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.560
they heat the whole room and they actually heat it,


00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.960
not just like turn it 450 like you're having.


00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.720
They actually heat it in these very precise stages that are


00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.560
time all over the course of this few nanoseconds.


00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:13.400
You're actually trying to ablate this rocket fuel in steps.


00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.680
You're not just trying to just blam.


00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.540
And doing that, you do that very precisely.


00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.420
So you're actually blowing a first step,


00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.600
and then you do another step,


00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.860
and then you actually hit it harder


00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:26.420
and really give it a good hard drive to really implode it.


00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.200
And all of that is happening by basically the lasers


00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.060
over the course of these few nanoseconds,


00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.960
just sort of pulsing in a sense, if you will,


00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.340
to heat this whole room in these stages.


00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.220
So all of that has to be just perfect.


00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.020
It has to be very uniform.


00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:42.700
And then that ends up driving this capsule.


00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.420
And the capsule doesn't want to actually implode.


00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.120
And that's another big thing is it's unstable.


00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.760
You never, nature doesn't want to take nature.


00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:52.180
They always say nature hates a vacuum.


00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.940
Nature also hates when you take every, all the rooms,


00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:57.980
I got Adams in a room and try to move them into one corner, right?


00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.260
It doesn't let you do that easily.


00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:00.580
Right.


00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.520
And that's basically kind of what we're trying to do.


00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.600
We're trying to take all of these fusion, these hydrogens and, and put them


00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.880
all together into a tiny, tiny space.


00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.420
And kind of like you'd imagine just trying to press a balloon together.


00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.520
We're trying to load this capsule by a factor of 30 in linear scale, 20 to 30.


00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.260
And, you know, if you tried to take a balloon and do that, right, you


00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:24.580
can imagine you push it in and it pops out where your, your fingers don't,


00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.920
you know, where your fingers aren't.


00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:29.080
So you bring in a friend and they, you push together and you're all pushing


00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.880
together and pretty soon the balloon is finding tiny little places to squeeze


00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.620
out, but, but it's going to find them.


00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:34.920
Right.


00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:37.920
And so you have to just basically iteratively, you know, make


00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.860
everything as perfect as possible.


00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:44.340
And, so the other hero of this achievement, not just the lasers, the


00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.140
lasers have been just going through these rather miraculous increments


00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:51.460
beyond their original design specs to the point where they're, they're


00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:55.220
delivering more energy than they were originally promised and with, with


00:22:55.220 --> 00:23:00.020
unprecedented smoothness and precision, but also the capsule and its smoothness


00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.380
and perfection is amazing.


00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.660
So like this capsule, these capsules, if you just sort of think of out of roundness,


00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.020
They're about 200 nanometers, maybe out of round, out of a millimeter.


00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.500
And, you know, the earth is roughly 20 kilometers out of, out of round, out of


00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.300
6,000.


00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.380
So these are, if you do those ratios, this, this is actually about 10 times


00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.460
rounder than the earth, you know, and it's just a tiny little, you know, millim,


00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.540
two millimeters across a capsule.


00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.020
Right.


00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.500
So they're, they're very, very smooth and that's something that's, that's been


00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:31.040
progressing.


00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.800
And I would say those two achievements are kind of the things that had to be


00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:40.200
incrementally improved to the point where you're trying to realize the ideal.


00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.960
Our codes are good at simulating ideals,


00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.120
and we do a lot of work to try to actually simulate the imperfections as well,


00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.080
and capture as many of those imperfections as possible.


00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.200
But we've always been able to do the ideal and say,


00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.640
"Yeah, the ideal works."


00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.400
The whole spherical cow ideal.


00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.960
>> It's exactly high around this ideal circle,


00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.120
and of course, it's going to work like this, and there you go.


00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.360
- Exactly, and it's like, oh, that works really well.


00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.640
And that's been the issue.


00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.080
And really what's happening is these large teams


00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.640
of experimentalists have been able to make the laser better


00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.680
and continue to and make these targets better.


00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.680
And they're actually getting closer and closer to ideals


00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.920
that even just a few years ago were like ridiculous.


00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:26.040
So it's really a testament to that hard work.


00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.200
- Yeah, really amazing.


00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.820
So what we're all learning is to collapse this balloon,


00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.520
you need 192 friends or 191 friends,


00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:34.120
if you don't count yourself right.


00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:40.560
>> Right. The fact that we're doing a can like this whole room is very important.


00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.120
We're not actually shining the lasers on the capsule.


00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:47.700
That's something that's called direct drive and indeed that is a field of study.


00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.900
That provides its own challenge because indeed,


00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:53.200
each laser is like a little fingertip trying to push on the capsule.


00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.880
This is so-called indirect drive because we're


00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:59.320
driving the capsule by the heating bath of the lasers.


00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.220
The lasers are heating this, this whole room and that's driving the capsule.


00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.240
So it's the actual, it's more of the shell that is playing the important


00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.440
role of, of doing the compression and you need to provide just enough


00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.880
controlled and even heating to make it go.


00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:13.360
Right.


00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:13.620
Yeah.


00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.360
You want to make that, that, but you still need to make that heating


00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.260
as controlled and even as you can.


00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:22.340
And it's still not even enough really when you, so there's been, you have to


00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.420
do a lot of work with, you know, making sure that heating, you know, where you


00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:29.160
put the beams, where the spots are, which are kind of like the elements in your


00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.880
oven, right? You know, if you turn on the broil elements, you'll burn your toast, right?


00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:38.240
And so you have to know where to put those elements, where do those spots hit the inside


00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.080
of the plurum to heat as uniformly as possible.


00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:45.680
Yeah. And people might be thinking, well, compressing something 30 times, it's not that


00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:49.880
crazy. We do that with air all the time. You look at combustion engines and other stuff,


00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:50.880
but you're also heating it.


00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.620
Well, it's 30 times linearly.


00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.800
You're also heating it to the near the temperature of the sun. It wants to get a lot bigger really


00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.240
It doesn't want to even stay where it is, right?


00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.280
- Absolutely, yes.


00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.320
You're heating it up to actually temperatures


00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.120
in excess of the center of the sun.


00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.560
So yeah, it doesn't want to be there.


00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.760
(laughing)


00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.600
- It wants to get moving.


00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.520
All right, fantastic.


00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.000
Let's just talk one more science side thing,


00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000
then we'll dive into the software side.


00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.400
This is the first time this has been done,


00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.000
and it's a huge accomplishment.


00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.520
How do you all see this very quick and small reaction


00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.720
potentially turning into actual energy sources.


00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.400
Where do we go from here to do something productive with this?


00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.120
>> It's important to note that


00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.560
the National Ignition Facility itself is a demonstration facility.


00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.920
It's a research facility.


00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.100
It's not meant to become an energy facility.


00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.560
Indeed, there are other startups out there,


00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.480
I think there are probably going to be more,


00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.880
that are exploring ways to commoditize this.


00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:51.480
It's interesting to think about the energy a little bit if I can.


00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:53.800
So just to kind of add a scale to this,


00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.760
you know, like a human eats about 2,000 calories


00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.100
of food a day, right, an adult, right?


00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:02.620
And those are actually kilocalories, nutritional calories.


00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.100
So that's two million calories, which is, you know,


00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:06.560
two megacalories.


00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:08.420
And it turns out that a calorie,


00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.860
it's kind of convenient, is four joules,


00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:14.020
another scientific measure of energy that we use all the time.


00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.620
So that two kilocalories we eat every day


00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:19.100
is basically two million calories,


00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:22.420
which is eight megajoules, eight million joules.


00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.180
So just multiply by that four.


00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:27.060
So eight megajoules you eat every day, right?


00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:30.520
So this laser is producing two megajoules,


00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.340
sort of like your breakfast, right, of energy.


00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:37.040
So it's actually not an unachievable amount of energy,


00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.700
but it does it in just a few nanoseconds, right?


00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:43.020
And I don't know how to describe a nanosecond all that well


00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.540
except to know that the speed of light is a good measure,


00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.460
right, the speed of light.


00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:50.780
So at the speed of light, a light wave can go around the Earth


00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:52.380
seven and a half times in a second.


00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.020
But in a nanosecond, light only goes 30 centimeters,


00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.500
so about a foot.


00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.700
And so I think that gives you an idea


00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.420
of just how quick that is.


00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.860
And so that's the key.


00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.740
- Yeah, it gives you a sense of how insane,


00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.180
how insanely precise those lasers have to be.


00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.700
- Exactly, yeah.


00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.100
- They've got that 30 centimeters.


00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:13.620
- Right, the entire, yeah, that's the cosmic speed limit.


00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:15.700
No information can go faster than that.


00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.440
and so everything has to be within this really small envelope.


00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.020
It's quite amazing.


00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.620
Then the reason why we're talking about this particular achievement is that it


00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.800
actually yielded a little over three megajoules,


00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.360
so maybe breakfast plus lunch in fusion yield.


00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:35.700
Again, that happened instantaneously effectively that was released.


00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.880
It's more about the release that makes it amazing.


00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.860
But the thing is that the energies aren't all that large at this point.


00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:48.300
And it occurred to me that, you know, well, if you think about it, it's kind of


00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.740
interesting to think about like, so going back to the food analogy, so you eat, make


00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:53.140
eight megajoules per day.


00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:56.980
A day is 24 hours times 60 minutes times 60 seconds.


00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.340
So 24 times 3,600, it's 80 or 90,000 seconds, right?


00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:06.940
So eight megajoules divided by say 80,000 seconds, that works out to a hundred


00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.980
joules per second or a hundred Watts.


00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.540
So you as a human, you know, burn a hundred Watts, right?


00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.100
which is a very, we use that term all the time.


00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.640
You can imagine taking a mannequin and putting


00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:24.240
a 100 watt incandescent bulb inside and it would heat up to our skin temperatures.


00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.180
We're going at a much,


00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.860
much higher wattage because we're doing it very quickly.


00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:33.680
You can actually think of a unit of measure that we often use in


00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.820
electricity and stuff is the kilowatt hour,


00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.720
1,000 watts times an hour,


00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.900
which is again, just 3,600.


00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:44.140
So a kilowatt hour is just 3.6 megajoules then,


00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:46.600
so 3,600 times 1,000 watts.


00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.580
So 3.6 megajoules is a kilowatt hour.


00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:53.520
- This portion of Talk Python to Me


00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.860
is brought to you by User Interviews.


00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:58.440
As a developer, how often do you find yourself


00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.440
talking back to products and services that you use?


00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:03.560
Sometimes it may be frustration


00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.920
over how it's working poorly,


00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.840
and if they just did such and such, it would work better,


00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.560
and it's easy to do.


00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.280
Other times it might be delight.


00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.440
Wow, they auto-filled that section for me.


00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.640
How did they even do that?


00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.120
Wonderful, thanks.


00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:19.440
While this verbalization might be great


00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.840
to get the thoughts out of your head,


00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.460
did you know that you can earn money


00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.740
for your feedback on real products?


00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:26.820
User interviews connects researchers


00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.840
with professionals that want to participate


00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.360
in research studies.


00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.320
There is a high demand for developers


00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.280
to share their opinions on products


00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.000
being created for developers.


00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.800
Aside from the extra cash,


00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:40.420
you'll talk to people building products in your space.


00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:44.560
You will not only learn about new tools being created, but you'll also shape the future


00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.820
of the products that we all use.


00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:51.780
It's completely free to sign up and you can apply to your first study in under five minutes.


00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.140
The average study pays over $60.


00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:59.380
However, many studies specifically interested in developers pay several hundreds of dollars


00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.140
for a one-on-one interview.


00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.980
Are you ready to earn extra income from sharing your expert opinion?


00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:10.220
Head over to talkpython.fm/userinterviews to participate today.


00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.020
The link is in your podcast player show notes.


00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.500
Thank you to user interviews for supporting the show.


00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:20.540
And not to put you on the spot, Michael, but do you know how much you pay for


00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.660
kilowatt hour for your electricity in your home?


00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:24.100
I think 17 cents.


00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.580
Oh, that's awesome.


00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.020
I'm so impressed.


00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.060
I'm pretty sure.


00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.860
I'm pretty sure as long as I have the units, right.


00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:31.660
Because yeah, no, that's about right.


00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:32.860
I have an electric car.


00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:36.540
I have little stuff that'll show me like, here's how much you charge and how much


00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:40.200
it pays into your price here to get your, like, so I'm pretty sure.


00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.640
I'm pretty sure it's 17.


00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.960
It might have gone up just a tiny bit.


00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.160
>> Okay. Yeah. I pay about 25 off peak and


00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.760
like 45 cents per kilowatt hour on peak.


00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.880
I have an EV and I'm aware of all that as well.


00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.000
Again, this shot produced about a little over


00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.440
three megajoules when a kilowatt hour is 3.6,


00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:01.980
which is, as you said,


00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.240
you can buy one for 17 cents.


00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.800
I can pretty much say with


00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.360
certainty that this experiment cost more than 17 cents.


00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.680
Even if you scale it up somewhat, it's going to be more than 17 cents.


00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:13.960
Yeah.


00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.200
Yeah.


00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.920
This one experiment for my one, one kilowatt hour I got out of, or a little


00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.720
less than a kilowatt hour I got out of it.


00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.080
That's, and nevermind that there was a certain amount put in, I had to put two


00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.720
megajoules in and there's inefficiencies as well, but so I think that just sort


00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.320
of outlines the challenge of scale.


00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:30.680
Right.


00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:35.280
I mean, so, you know, I have to make a capsule that's way, way cheaper


00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.840
than 17 cents to make money.


00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:41.540
I have to, you know, probably I want to get more than a kilowatt hour per shot.


00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:45.140
I'll probably want to 10 or a hundred kilowatt hours per per shot.


00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:48.140
And then I'm going to have to have a lot of high rep rate because ultimately to


00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:52.300
power your home and my home and a town's home, you know, you need lots of kilowatt


00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:52.700
hours.


00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:55.140
And so, you know, scaling it up is a challenge.


00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:59.340
I think that's just sort of a nice way to illustrate, you know, where you have


00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:00.180
to go to get there.


00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:00.540
Yeah.


00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.660
You got to start somewhere though.


00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:04.220
The first transistors, I'm sure were expensive.


00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:05.900
You know, the first, Oh, exactly.


00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.480
100 kilobytes of hard drive storage seemed just insane.


00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.280
If you told somebody, well, we're going to need a terabyte on everybody's computer,


00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.660
like, no, we can't do that.


00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.280
>> Exactly. Yeah. Absolutely.


00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.360
>> On an SD card, nothing.


00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:21.200
>> Exactly. There's a lot to do.


00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.000
There's a lot of growth there that needs to happen.


00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.280
>> It's early stage for sure.


00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.120
>> Right.


00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.520
>> Awesome. Let's talk about some of the software side.


00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.840
I know that you guys have over at the LLNL,


00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.800
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, you have a software portal.


00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.360
We have a bunch of different applications and things that you're sharing, which are really great.


00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.160
And so I know that you've got a lot of neat things happening on the software side.


00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:46.720
Your area has been largely around designing and simulating the experiments.


00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.960
And then once someone runs them to go, "Okay, I got some data. How'd that work? How do we adjust?"


00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:55.200
Maybe talk to us about some of the software side of what you're doing there.


00:33:55.200 --> 00:34:00.200
Yeah, right. Like we were saying, our kind of design cycle is that we have these


00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.560
quite impressive multi physics codes that can simulate these experiments,


00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:08.800
right, that actually mock up the whole room and the capsule inside and,


00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:13.400
and actually fake lasers in and run the how they would interact with


00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.480
the gold atoms and actually run the entire simulation.


00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.880
But, you know, usually don't want to just push the button and just have it come out.


00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:23.180
Usually you're asking questions about it,


00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:25.120
you're instrumenting it up, if you will,


00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:26.720
you're test, you're checking things.


00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.320
So you're kind of steering these simulations.


00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:33.820
And so one of the big facets of software that we've been working on for


00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:37.120
the last few years is to improve that steering in Python.


00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.480
We can talk a little bit more about that.


00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.280
But then also we have,


00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.840
so then you get out your simulations result, right?


00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:45.360
You say, "Oh, well, this result did such and such," right?


00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.420
But now you want to actually compare it to data.


00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.720
So you have to go over to a web page or talk to


00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:53.200
somebody who ran an experiment on NIF and talk to them and get that data.


00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:56.240
So that's another area that we've been working really hard on over


00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.240
the last five or six years I've been to try to improve that ability to so that


00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:04.200
basically we're kind of bringing all the parties together so that the making the


00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.960
simulations easier to run easier to work with and also having the data and tools


00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:13.560
proximate to that so that we can all sit in one place and actually ask all the


00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:17.680
questions and get all the answers in that one spot. So historically that's


00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:22.520
kind of been the design cycle and it's been fairly organic right where people


00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:27.200
will write tools that work for them to steer code or to do some post-processing,


00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:29.140
and then they'll share them with people,


00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.240
and then somebody else will share it,


00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:35.320
and they'll tweak it, and eventually somebody will quit asking


00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.960
just friends and they'll put it in a directory somewhere, make it readable.


00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.600
That had been the way we'd done business for a while,


00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.120
and we're trying to actually improve that.


00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.480
About five or six years ago,


00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.720
I was designing some experiments for the NIF,


00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.040
and I was running one of these tools that were sort of an organically grown thing,


00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.920
and I was trying to do something that was a little bit challenging for it,


00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.440
and a little bit out of its strengths.


00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:03.340
I basically kind of had an existential crisis.


00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.220
I just thought, "I can't do this anymore.


00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:07.240
These tools aren't cutting it."


00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.240
The code underneath is great,


00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:13.640
but I'm just beating my head against the wall to talk to it and to get things out of it.


00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:18.140
You can really burn a lot of human time doing that, which is very expensive.


00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:21.880
So I basically just stopped running those tools.


00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.460
It was just like the whole office space thing,


00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.420
where the guy post hypnotic suggestion.


00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:31.900
>> I don't think I want to go to work today.


00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.460
>> Exactly.


00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:34.820
>> I don't think I want to do that either.


00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.940
I just got it done.


00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:42.980
>> It was kind of like that.


00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.740
I just felt like I can't do that anymore.


00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.940
and I think my time would be better spent


00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.860
trying to improve the model, improve the ecosystem.


00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:54.340
Again, so I am drinking the Python Kool-Aid all the time,


00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.380
learning more and more about the ecosystem,


00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.940
also learning just about Git and continuous integration,


00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:04.300
just things that are out there that I'd been entirely naive about myself,


00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.820
and realizing that, oh,


00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.420
there's actually things to do.


00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.180
In all fairness, of course, other people are


00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:13.140
thinking things like this as well as per the page you've got up here.


00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:16.540
The lab has tons of people who are doing this stuff in spades.


00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:23.260
But there are a little corner of ignition land that wasn't happening as much as I wanted.


00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:28.860
I basically looked around and I found a couple things that other people had just been starting.


00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.380
One of them is basically a Python wrapper of one of our codes.


00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.340
We have one of our multi-physics codes,


00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:36.540
we call it Hydra.


00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.220
The developer physicist, Joe Koning,


00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:42.180
did the hard work of actually installing Python.


00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:44.020
and a Python interpreter into that.


00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:47.660
So it actually talks to this big multiphysics parallel code.


00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:50.300
>> Interesting. So it's actually hosting the Python runtime,


00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:54.900
not the other way around where Python is trying to wrap it C API?


00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.660
>> Right. No, the code itself is running and


00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.980
Python is just bolted on top of it.


00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:01.860
>> Okay.


00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:05.260
>> Yeah. So the code is still in control.


00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.460
It's actually very challenging and Joe did


00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:09.740
a great job of doing that after the fact.


00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:17.140
But now you have the ability to actually, you know, to initialize the problem and tell it its run state purely in Python.


00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:23.300
And he was starting to build an infrastructure to develop our problems, our ignition problems, these whole arms and capsules and such.


00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.820
And I just jumped in on that. I thought this is what we have to do.


00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:31.260
It was a tremendous amount of effort to build that up to make it something that actually worked.


00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:38.540
But I think that it's actually one of the easier tools out there, most robust and user-friendly tools we have now.


00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:43.700
And so that's sort of the one half of the puzzle is just making a Python interface,


00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.580
a purely Python interface to run these tools.


00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:51.380
And again, so this tool we call HyPy for the Hydra Python deck,


00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:55.020
and again, Joe Koenig initiated it, and I've been really involved,


00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.060
and Chris Young has gotten involved since then, helping a lot.


00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:03.740
And so we basically just tried to build the entire ecosystem of how do you initialize the horum,


00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:05.980
and the capsule, and the laser, and all of those things,


00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.180
so that you can tell this hydrocode to run and give you some results.


00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:15.020
That's been a big push that I've been championing and proselytizing on.


00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.380
The other half of it,


00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:19.080
and this goes back to Dave Monroe and Yorick,


00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:20.620
like I was mentioning earlier,


00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:22.680
a lot of people use Yorick.


00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.460
It's a very, very useful tool for data analysis.


00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:28.360
Again, it's an interactive tool with a very,


00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.180
very nice array syntax.


00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.780
Think of it like interpreted C,


00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:38.060
if C syntax was just interpreted with a really nice array syntax built on.


00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:40.340
So it's still quite widely used,


00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:41.980
but I think to Dave's credit,


00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.900
Dave Monroe's credit as he was near retirement a couple of years ago,


00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:47.900
he decided that Python was the way to go.


00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.980
He decided that the future was going with


00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:53.740
leveraging what's out there and just going with Python.


00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:56.620
>> When you're the one who created your thing and you're like,


00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:57.940
"You know what? I love my baby,


00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.660
but it's time to think beyond."


00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:03.260
Absolutely. I don't think he gets enough credit for that.


00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.100
I have immense respect for that because, I mean,


00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:08.060
I don't know if I was to do that.


00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:12.180
A lot of people become very protective of their babies,


00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:15.740
but no, it's what's best.


00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:18.260
Before, the thing that's nice,


00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:21.820
one of the nice things about Yorick is a lot like Matlab or Mathematica.


00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.500
When you type Yorick and open a shell,


00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.340
everything you get is right there.


00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.540
It's a single environment.


00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:30.900
>> Like it or not, Python is a little more


00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:33.060
heterogeneous and diverse than that.


00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:35.180
It's a feature in a bug.


00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:39.100
One of the things he wanted to do as a parting gift to us,


00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:42.780
is he created this tool called IDesign that is basically,


00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.740
at its core, it's a Python virtual environment that just


00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:49.420
pip installs all of the packages that we like to do.


00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.340
There's a lot of them that we've been building to create


00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.460
this Python ecosystem that will then talk to


00:40:55.460 --> 00:40:59.420
this Hypeide Hydra simulation layer.


00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.800
Basically, then everybody can just type Python,


00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.340
and they'll get that environment.


00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:08.100
By itself, that's not all that big a deal,


00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.680
but it does actually have a certain amount of


00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.900
nice features that we've been able to build it


00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:15.200
into our GitLab continuous integration environment.


00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.380
We built an awful lot on it since he did retire.


00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:21.500
You can take snapshots of


00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.220
those environment state and some other things.


00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:28.180
People have told us we need to open source that I've sort of balked at it,


00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:31.060
but I think I've made the decision that we're going to.


00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.380
So, IDesign will eventually be on that page you were showing earlier.


00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:37.500
So, you know, hopefully in a year or whatever, we're going to do that.


00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.700
But another key component, I think one of the things I get excited about,


00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.700
and it's one of the things that's exciting about Python in general,


00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:47.820
is the fact that, you know, that you can have these, it's an enabling technology, right?


00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:50.140
And so now that you have an IDesign environment,


00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:53.100
everybody can come into a uniform Python environment,


00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.620
and everybody speaks the same languages,


00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.420
has the same tools at their disposal.


00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:59.260
Well, now you can actually build in tools to go


00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.180
grab data from the NIF databases,


00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.440
where they're running shots and they're compiling all of this data.


00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.940
It's not always as easily accessible as you would like for


00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:13.940
maybe a non-expert in that particular diagnostic or whatever.


00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.780
What we've been doing is another big campaign,


00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:19.060
a part of this iDesign ecosystem is that we've


00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.380
been building what's called a shot data pipeline.


00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:24.300
And again, this runs in the GitLab continuous integration environment.


00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:28.780
Every night we go off to a bunch of databases and just harvest a whole bunch of data,


00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:32.540
bring it in and rebuild this IDesign environment with physical data,


00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:36.100
again, the tools, and then the ability to actually run the code,


00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.500
all in Python, right? All in one environment.


00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.700
Yeah, probably before when people run the experiments,


00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.900
I don't know what before is, maybe way far back, but


00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.900
when you get started, you know, you're like, "Okay, I got to get the data here,


00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.980
and then we got to maybe process it and then convert it to this other form,


00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.880
and then filter this down and then finally we can get it so we can import it over here


00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:54.880
and process it.


00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.880
Right?


00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.780
So you're talking about, well, what if you had a CI pipeline that could do a bunch of


00:42:58.780 --> 00:42:59.780
these sort of steps, right?


00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.260
Is that the idea?


00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.260
Basically.


00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:06.820
So experimental physicists who know their diagnostics extremely well, and so they actually


00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:10.460
will take that raw data and distill it to something useful.


00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:16.820
We're really just doing the more prosaic step of going and getting it and bringing it so


00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.940
that it's proximate to the designer.


00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:21.580
That's one of those things it's like,


00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:23.380
well, yeah, just go get it.


00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.380
But it's a huge task and it wastes


00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:27.220
an awful lot of designer time when you


00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.500
have to chase down data for shots.


00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.500
>> How much data are you talking in?


00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:32.880
>> It's not a lot of data really,


00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:37.620
but per shot, you might only be dealing with few numbers,


00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:40.420
few scalers, and then it can go up to images.


00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:42.020
You can ask for a lot of,


00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.060
you can get more detailed pictures,


00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.980
but even you might just be looking for just a few numbers.


00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:50.900
But the thing is, if you have to go ask for those few numbers every time,


00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.340
it's not like it always has to happen.


00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:55.720
It's just there wasn't a process in place to just try to,


00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:56.860
that was the culture.


00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:59.040
When you want something, you just go ask somebody.


00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:03.060
That's fine, but we've been trying to make the culture a little bit more like,


00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:06.340
let's provide it and let's automatically rate it.


00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:08.660
I think that's been really an exciting.


00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:10.820
This whole Python framework has been


00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:14.340
the enabling technology to allow that to happen.


00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.460
We're just at the point now over the last year or so that,


00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.920
in fact, a lot of this stuff is still coming to fruition right now.


00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.960
You'd still consider it Alpha and Beta,


00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.600
but it's actually finally coming together,


00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:26.960
which I think is really exciting.


00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:31.000
That starts maybe slowly changing the culture,


00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.240
where people start expecting,


00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.720
"Hey, it's actually easy for me if I just put my data in a spot


00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.080
and those shot data pipeline guys,


00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.440
we're going to just going to harvest every night.


00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.280
I don't have to worry about it. I don't have to feel email.


00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:48.520
- Once the foundation of the automation is there


00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.560
and people start to realize they can trust it,


00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:53.440
then you start to get creative and put more things on there


00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.520
and leverage it more and it just makes a lot of--


00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:56.800
- Exactly. - A lot of stuff take off.


00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:58.040
- It's Pi PI, right?


00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:58.880
It's small.


00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.940
- It is, it is.


00:45:00.940 --> 00:45:03.720
- And another part of that is that the design community,


00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:06.040
which again, I talked about how a lot of things,


00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.320
people will develop tools


00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.000
and then they'll just share them when asked,


00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.880
maybe put it in a directory somewhere.


00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.480
Well, now we have a place


00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.520
where you can actually have your own repository.


00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:17.240
And maybe a physicist isn't all that interested


00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:19.240
in learning what a Git repository is,


00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:20.320
but we can help with that.


00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.340
You know, I mean, it can become a place


00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:24.320
where you can have your tools and they're available


00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.460
and they're deployed because we also have the issue


00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.080
that we have systems that are air-gapped, right?


00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.720
And so we need to have this whole distribution mirrored


00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:35.560
over here with a physical pass-off, right?


00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.660
And so we try to do that now regularly


00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:39.460
rather than just piecemeal.


00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.560
And, you know, hey, if you create a little tool


00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.200
or whatever it is, it's just everywhere all of a sudden.


00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.360
That's really new and I think that's again,


00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:51.080
very empowering for the designers who are creating these new experiment.


00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.480
>> I think people who haven't experienced it,


00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.960
these organizations, these research labs and other similar places,


00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.060
they basically become software companies.


00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.960
At least they have a software team that is


00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:05.600
functioning really at a pretty high level in them.


00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:10.320
I worked at a research place that had six or seven PhDs and a bunch of grad students,


00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.520
and me and another software developer,


00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.460
and we were writing software full-time,


00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:17.520
and it just, it kept getting better and better,


00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:20.960
and what actually the grad students would say to me is,


00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.280
if you keep doing this, we're gonna be out of a job.


00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.280
All the software you're writing, this is what we do.


00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.820
And like, no, what you're gonna do


00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:30.160
is you're gonna do actual science and actually better stuff,


00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.440
and every time they'd be like, well, this was my job,


00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.760
and here it is a button now.


00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.840
And nobody was fired from that.


00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.400
They just did more interesting stuff


00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.360
and took on more ambitious projects.


00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.280
It's pretty cool to see.


00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.360
>> Exactly. I've been accused of that before.


00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.800
You're going to put us all out of the job.


00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.360
But it's like, no, no.


00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.000
Your job is so much more interesting now,


00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.600
and my job is more interesting.


00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:54.480
I spend a lot of time developing now.


00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.920
I've made this my passion.


00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.560
I have a smaller fraction of my time doing designing experiments,


00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.820
not zero, but smaller.


00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:03.920
But I actually feel like it's much,


00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.840
much more efficient than it ever was.


00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.000
>> Yeah. You might have a bigger impact though,


00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.200
even though it's less time.


00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.460
>> Yeah, exactly.


00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.840
It's just a lot more efficient and it's fun to show


00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:18.260
younger people who are coming in how to do this and that


00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:22.940
it doesn't have to be what I consider a painful cycle.


00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.440
I mean, maybe some people enjoy it.


00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:28.260
Yeah. I like to say that I feel like I'm


00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:31.620
building the tools that I wish I had when I started.


00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:33.820
I think it's happening.


00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:38.740
Again, we have a really great team of folks that we're


00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:42.460
working with, I work with, you know, computer scientists, Ryan Tran and Jimmy


00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:44.700
Smith, who helped me build this stuff out.


00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:47.140
And it's, it's just been, it's been really great.


00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:47.980
Sounds fantastic.


00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.100
How many people are on the team?


00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:51.920
So it's just a small and a certain amount of it is, you know,


00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.540
people who, who want to help.


00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:56.580
So it's just a few of us, you know, again, Joe coding and Chris


00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:59.060
Young and Dave Strozzi, and such.


00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:02.540
So, and again, but then there, there are a lot of people who are


00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:04.620
starting to become contributors.


00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:06.700
That's where the leverage starts.


00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:08.660
Sort of a stone soup thing.


00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:13.020
>> Yeah. On the NIF more broadly, how many people are involved?


00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:18.540
>> NIF? Hundreds. Jeremy on the call here might be able to give an actual number,


00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:21.300
but it's hundreds of scientists.


00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.340
For scale, you have to keep in mind that


00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:26.380
the Lawrence Livermore Lab has thousands of scientists.


00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:29.500
Even though the NIF is a big program,


00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:33.620
it's actually fairly small as a part of the greater lab portfolio.


00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:37.740
I guess I want to emphasize that I'm speaking for the design corner.


00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:39.220
there's the experimental corner,


00:48:39.220 --> 00:48:42.180
the people who actually work with the hardware of the NIF and stuff.


00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:46.220
We talked to them particularly with vis-a-vis the ShotData pipeline.


00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:49.580
There are a lot of places that have their own architectures.


00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:51.780
You can see that with the open source page and stuff.


00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:54.260
So there's a tremendous amount and a lot of those things are doing


00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:56.660
really great their own great infrastructures.


00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:01.540
But this is really speaking towards the needs of the NIF ignition community.


00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:06.380
>> Yeah. You talked about the specific libraries that you are really


00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:08.960
focused on the work there,


00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.960
but I'm sure you used a bunch of


00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.920
standard Python libraries,


00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.420
packages that people are familiar with.


00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.620
Maybe give us a sense of some of the tools and


00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:20.040
things that were at play that you're taking advantage of.


00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.740
>> Oh, yeah. Well, of course,


00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:24.020
we're using all the NumPy, SciPy stuff.


00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.500
That's a given.


00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.380
We also, in Dye Design,


00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:31.440
we have PlasmaPy and X-Ray,


00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.880
DB, and some of these.


00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:44.180
Again, these really nice physical data packages that people have developed in the open source community that now we just sort of bring in so that it's always there and maintained for designers at your fingertips.


00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:48.420
Certain number of us also do, yeah, there you go, the page there you brought up.


00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:50.420
>> pip install PlasmaPy.


00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:52.420
>> Or conda if you prefer.


00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.420
>> There you go, yeah.


00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:58.740
A lot of us, including myself, are getting involved in machine learning as well.


00:49:58.740 --> 00:50:04.740
Of course, that's an important part of the emerging technology people are excited to take advantage of.


00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:09.700
And so I install PyTorch into IDesign and try to make sure that's...


00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:11.060
Which is a bit of a challenge, right?


00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:14.500
Because we have really large, different architectures,


00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.740
and taking advantage of their different GPUs.


00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.780
It's not necessarily just a pip install.


00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:20.900
I might have to compile it.


00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.060
And so there are challenges there.


00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:27.260
but we try to just make that available for the design community,


00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.980
which is cool because again,


00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:31.260
I mean, not to harp on the enabling technology thing,


00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.260
but we can now and I do,


00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:35.780
again, as a research thing,


00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:39.660
I can import PyTorch into my HiPy that runs


00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:43.400
my big Hydra multi-physics simulation and have it do


00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:47.000
inference on some part of the simulation,


00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.540
and maybe even offload part of that.


00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:52.140
So there have been other, there are other efforts at the lab


00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.500
as looking at those kinds of things as well.


00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.260
But again, I don't know how you would do that


00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.720
without these tools that we've been building, frankly,


00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.720
at least in our corner of the world.


00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:02.420
- Yeah, you gotta keep building that foundation


00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:05.180
until everything is ready to click it together.


00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:06.500
Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, exactly.


00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.340
- While it's fun to imagine what would happen


00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:13.100
if you ask chatGTP to say,


00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:17.020
imagine chatGTP you had the most precise lasers in the world,


00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.260
how would you design a fusion experiment?


00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:22.140
I'm sure that's not gonna result in much.


00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:26.220
Where do you actually see real constructive AI


00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:27.980
applied to this or machine learning?


00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.580
Do you have anything that you see on the radar there?


00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.780
- There are several things that it's being applied to.


00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:38.460
And in fact, maybe you can find some links here


00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:40.120
that there have been some,


00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.420
there's a group that sort of predicted,


00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:44.820
they gave some confidence whether this shot


00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.340
was going to achieve ignition, right?


00:51:46.340 --> 00:51:50.600
where they're trying to learn from the experience of past shots and try to get


00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:54.860
some idea of predicting how a future shot will perform.


00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:57.640
Those are new things that are happening.


00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:03.120
I think the two sides of it are probably those kinds of high-level things where you're


00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:07.300
trying to ask big questions about what would happen if I do this.


00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:11.000
But there's the other level of using it to


00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.840
offload some of the big numerical heavy lifting that we do all the time.


00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:18.900
We run a lot of, the simulations run massive calculations


00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:23.380
trying to do the physics of these lasers shining into these whole rooms and such.


00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:27.180
Some of those calculations could be learned by an inference engine


00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:31.500
and just maybe a simplified version provided over and over.


00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:34.780
There are several efforts being applied to that.


00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:38.420
We're trying to basically train an agent to just learn some part of


00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:42.380
how the simulation, what physical data the simulation should provide.


00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:43.940
I've worked on some of those things.


00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:45.600
there's more of that going on.


00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:47.240
There's more details to that as well.


00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.840
I mean, the way we do our simulations,


00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.040
we divide, you can think of


00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:55.080
our simulations or multi-physics simulations like an image.


00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:58.320
To make an image, you divide it up into a whole bunch of


00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.480
little tiny pixels and each pixel has


00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.380
a red, green, blue value and that's what makes your image.


00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:05.800
We do that with our simulations.


00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:08.400
If you want to simulate a whole room with a capsule inside,


00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.760
you basically divide it up into a whole bunch of little tiny pixels.


00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:15.080
we call them nodes and we interconnect them with their nearest neighbors.


00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:17.560
So they create that links into a mesh.


00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:20.120
Rather than having red, green, blue,


00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.760
we have physics attributes.


00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.400
We tell it what it's made of.


00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.680
That node is what it's made of,


00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.800
how hot it is, things like that.


00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:28.160
It's ionization state.


00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.160
Then we run the laws of physics on all of


00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:33.920
these nodes as they talk to each other and then that unfolds.


00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:37.240
But as you can imagine, if you have a mesh of all these nodes,


00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.080
they can tangle up and they can get all messed up.


00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.660
One of the things that we do is we have a certain amount of


00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:46.380
algorithms to try to keep that tangling


00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:49.860
from happening too much and crashing simulations.


00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:52.400
That's an inside baseball thing,


00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.780
but that's one of the things,


00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:56.480
then I'm one of the side projects I have,


00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:58.020
for instance, of actually using


00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:00.180
reinforcement learning to try to figure out,


00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:03.080
just by giving it a whole bunch of trials,


00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:05.900
what's the best policy for relaxing


00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:09.420
these nodes so that they don't crash a simulation.


00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:12.580
These things just make simulations easier again,


00:54:12.580 --> 00:54:14.640
and all of this, so you can ask


00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:17.900
questions and explore more quickly and easily.


00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:21.500
>> We all know how tricky even three-body problems


00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:24.900
are in an orbiting system where they can become chaotic.


00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:28.700
Well, imagine this thing you're


00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:31.900
describing is the interactions are insane.


00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:32.980
>> Oh, yeah.


00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:34.540
>> If you could get something to predict,


00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:37.140
you just say, here's a million different examples of what


00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:41.460
happened, how it started, how it started, how's it going, sort of examples.


00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:43.460
>> Exactly. You got it.


00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:46.020
>> It started, we're thinking here,


00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:47.460
how's it going to go, right?


00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:50.780
>> Right. Of course, that's an experience in itself.


00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:53.220
I mean, to actually take these forays into data science and


00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:57.860
large-scale datasets and training in multiple GPUs and stuff like that,


00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:59.060
it's been fun.


00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:01.040
I mean, I know people do that all the time,


00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.500
but it's interesting to have that experience.


00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:05.820
>> Yeah, for sure. There are some interesting articles of


00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:09.120
actually the CogSim team at LLNL


00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.440
and some of the work being done there.


00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.160
So I'll link to those articles in the show notes.


00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:14.120
People can check that out.


00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.000
- That is the team I'm kind of referring to,


00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.920
that there is this effort to bring machine learning


00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.520
to bear on some of these problems.


00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.000
So that's good work that they're doing.


00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
- Yeah, of course.


00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.080
We're getting short on time here,


00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:29.080
but let's wrap this up with one other aspect.


00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.560
You talked about having air-gapped systems


00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.760
and not everything necessarily should be online


00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.680
or is online.


00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.800
you want it to be all kind of isolated and stable.


00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:40.960
So, and then you've got a lot of computation


00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.360
you gotta be doing.


00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.800
Tell us just a bit about the computing environment.


00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:48.700
Do you have like interesting clusters or grid computing


00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:51.680
or what's the story for actually running all this stuff?


00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:53.240
- Yeah, yeah, good question.


00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.240
Yeah, there's, for the context.


00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:58.740
So basically we have a bunch of very, very large


00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.200
computer clusters at the lab.


00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:03.080
And some of them, you know, are like near the biggest


00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.480
computers in the world or were at one time.


00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.480
I don't keep track of that,


00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.960
but those are all on lists and there are new ones


00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:13.200
on the horizon that will take that crown again.


00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.800
What we do is basically submit our jobs,


00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:18.760
carving out some chunk of the machine to run


00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:23.040
these multi-physics simulations for so many hours or days.


00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:26.680
We're doing that. We do a certain amount of that on the open side,


00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:30.500
but then we also have a lot of resources on these air gap systems.


00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:32.320
We do a lot of our running there.


00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:35.620
That's sort of the exigency of moving our data,


00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:38.120
physical data from the NIF and our tools over there.


00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:41.080
So we always have up-to-date tools to run there.


00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.740
These are made by different vendors.


00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:44.980
It's interesting, they're evolving where there's


00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:47.380
larger GPU components than there used to be,


00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:50.360
and the codes are learning to adapt to that.


00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:52.440
So it's a fairly dynamic environment.


00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.460
That's kind of, I guess,


00:56:53.460 --> 00:56:56.420
the general run environment we have,


00:56:56.420 --> 00:57:00.200
that we're running on a bunch of clusters.


00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:03.040
How's quantum computing looking?


00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:06.200
Are there any quantum applicable problems here?


00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.280
>> Not directly from my experience.


00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.880
I know there are some people working on quantum computing at the lab,


00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.080
closely attached to that.


00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:13.480
>> Yeah.


00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:17.520
>> I'm specifically thinking if you had a quantum computer,


00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:21.280
would this allow you, not necessarily trying to invent quantum computing,


00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.600
but somebody happens to.


00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:26.600
>> Probably not. Maybe somebody else would know something.


00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:30.160
But yeah, I mean, really, we're just trying to kind of, you know, integrate


00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.680
these differential equations that describe the physical system.


00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.960
And, you know, maybe there's a way to diagonalize a matrix with quantum


00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:42.000
computing that's way, way better than an explicit method, you know, that we use.


00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.360
But, yeah, I'm not, I'm not aware of it at this point.


00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:49.320
I definitely don't know enough about quantum computing to even suggest that.


00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:55.240
Well, I guess we're due now, if we, if these, these barriers are falling, right?


00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.080
Yeah, exactly.


00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.620
We need to try and be ready to do things.


00:57:59.620 --> 00:58:01.540
Be careful what you wish for though, right?


00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:05.040
I mean, having been able to crack any password, I don't know if that's a good thing.


00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.040
Exactly.


00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.240
I'd love faster computers.


00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.680
Wait, baking doesn't work anymore.


00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:09.680
Oh no.


00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:10.680
Right.


00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:15.840
Back to rubbing sticks together and sleeping on the wood.


00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:20.240
I've got my money clip that I keep everything on my person.


00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:21.240
Exactly.


00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:22.240
I'll, I'll do that.


00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:23.080
on my person.


00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.040
(laughs)


00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:24.880
- Exactly.


00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:28.240
I'll mail you some cash in physical mail.


00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:29.080
Get this.


00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:29.900
- Right, right.


00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:30.740
- You write careful what we wish for.


00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:31.580
(laughs)


00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:33.040
And we won't have much cash


00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:34.880
'cause chatGTP will be writing our software


00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.080
that we used to write though.


00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:36.920
It'll be fine.


00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:37.740
- Well, this is true.


00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:38.580
This is true.


00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:39.400
(laughs)


00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.640
- No, honestly, I'm very optimistic about the future


00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:43.880
in a lot of these things and especially this.


00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:45.440
So, awesome work.


00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.320
Now, before you get out of here,


00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:48.440
let me ask you the final two questions.


00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:50.560
If you're gonna work on some of these Python projects,


00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:51.840
what editor are you using?


00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:54.640
I've gone through the litany of editors in my evolution.


00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:57.120
I started with VI and went to Emacs,


00:58:57.120 --> 00:58:58.780
went and used Emacs for a very long time.


00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:00.540
Then probably five or so years ago,


00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:04.400
I decided I need to make a change and I went to Adam.


00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:08.840
I can use Emacs binding so I didn't have to rewire my muscle memory.


00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:11.020
Really enjoyed that until of course,


00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:13.320
last summer when they killed it.


00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:14.680
I had to look around.


00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:16.760
It was funny because I had a summer student who I


00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.680
just told how to use Adam and I was like, "Oh, this is great."


00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:23.040
and then I had to tell him literally a week later, forget that.


00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:25.840
>> The thing you really love, they canceled it. I'm sorry.


00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:29.320
>> Yeah. Just don't. He liked it too.


00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:34.640
I looked around and I think I did what a lot of people are doing with VS Code.


00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.000
I love it. My goodness, it's really mature and good.


00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:44.480
Co-pilot, again, I'm still learning how to use it effectively,


00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.440
but it's amazing, it's a state changer.


00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:47.800
>> It is absolutely amazing.


00:59:47.800 --> 00:59:49.520
because we are working on clusters,


00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:50.640
a lot of things are remote.


00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:54.400
The fact that you can do remote SSH and you can have


00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:58.680
your software here and your notebook here and then a terminal below it,


00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:02.680
and it's all just in your VS Code window, it's pretty sweet.


01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.360
>> Yeah. You connect to it,


01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.960
have your editor running locally,


01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:08.000
but connected to that area.


01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.880
>> There's no delay with typing and all,


01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:13.800
but you are running on the heavy iron somewhere, the big iron somewhere.


01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:19.800
Indeed, I feel like VS Code is maybe the natural successor to people who did Sublime and Atom.


01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:22.800
Those are the, I see that kind of that flow there.


01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.300
All right, and then a notable PyPI package?


01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:37.800
Right off the bat, you put up at the beginning, you know, llnl.github.io is, I think, you know, a really good resource for just sort of seeing the open source packages that are being developed at the lab.


01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.300
And again, they have a bent towards high performance computing and such.


01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.700
And like I said, eventually, I design will be up there.


01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:45.200
We'll open source that.


01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:48.200
I will mention one that Dave Monroe, again,


01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.900
and is sort of trying to take care of us before he retired.


01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:54.200
He wrote a nice little package called QND,


01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.500
which is on this for quick and dirty QND,


01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:59.900
and that's now being maintained by Dave Strozzi.


01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.100
And it's a nice little package,


01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.600
but what it does is actually unifies an interface


01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:06.500
for several different binary formats,


01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.200
in particular, HDF5, NetCDF,


01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.000
and a lab internal format called PDB.


01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.640
It's one of those things that passes the test in my mind


01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:18.320
where I've actually reached for it in my own just little projects,


01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.800
where if I need to just store some data,


01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.880
NumPy has its own storage thing,


01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.600
but it doesn't do really good if you have


01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.720
a hierarchical data or if you want to do


01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:31.800
records and have things stored over time.


01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:35.160
But this is actually a simple enough and uniform enough interface


01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:38.320
that it's like, wow, this really works.


01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:41.720
So anytime you actually reach for it when you just need that tool,


01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.800
I think that it's past some threshold of usability.


01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.000
Again, it's open source and I think for people who do things like that,


01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.480
work with binary data,


01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:54.320
I think this might be something that other people might want to look at.


01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.960
>> One of those Lego building blocks.


01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:56.680
>> Yeah, exactly.


01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.600
>> One other question,


01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:02.280
people out there who are really interested in what you're talking about,


01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:07.160
and maybe they previously thought of LL and LL is just a place for a physicist,


01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:11.160
And maybe you're starting to think, maybe it's a place for software people and data scientists.


01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.920
Are you guys hiring?


01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:14.760
We are actually.


01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:20.760
Absolutely, actually, right now, strangely, you know, I think there might be some tailwinds after


01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:25.320
the success. That's above my pay grade, but I think that, you know, there's something that


01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.240
should be happening. There should be a lot more good stuff going on. But right now, even there's


01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:35.160
a lot of hiring going on. And so if you find some of this, you know, interesting Python chops,


01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.080
you know, check us out, definitely.


01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:38.760
Jay, thanks for being here.


01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.040
Congratulations once again.


01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.400
It's really amazing work, and I know it's early days,


01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.920
but we'll look back on it, I'm sure.


01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:45.880
Yeah, thank you, Michael.


01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.480
Yeah, it's been a lot of fun.


01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.440
It's fun to be a part of it and look back on the road.


01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:51.880
It's still a long road ahead.


01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:53.880
It is, but I'll be tracking it.


01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.320
It'll be exciting to see where it goes.


01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:55.820
Thanks.


01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:59.960
