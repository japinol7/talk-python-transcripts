00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:04.640
Do you feel like ADHD is holding you back? Maybe you don't personally have it, but you work with

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.760
folks who do, and you'd like to support them better. Either way, how ADHD interplays with

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.800
programming and programmers is pretty fascinating. On this episode, we have Chris Ferdinandi,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.280
who himself has ADHD and has written a lot about it to share his journey and his advice for thriving

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.360
with ADHD as a programmer or data scientist. This is Talk Python to Me, episode 473,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.920
out at talkpython.fm/courses. Before we jump into the interview, I want to let you know that we

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.360
still have some spots left in my Code in a Castle event. If you're looking to learn some of the

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.320
premier frameworks and techniques in Python, and you'd like to have a bucket list type of experience

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:11.360
while doing so, then check out talkpython.fm/castle. In October, I'll be running a six-day Python

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.600
course for an intimate audience in a villa in Tuscany. Half the time we'll be learning Python

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.840
and the other half will be exploring the best of what Italy has to offer. Check out the course

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.400
outline, the excursions, and all the details at talkpython.fm/castle. Or if you'd like, just shoot

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.360
me an email, michael@talkpython.fm, or find me on the socials and I'm happy to talk about it.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.680
I hope to see you there. Chris, welcome to Talk Python to Me. Michael, thank you so much for

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.440
having me. It's great to be here. I'm really looking forward to talking about this kind of

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.480
meta-developer topic. You know, we're both developers and course creators and things

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.160
like that, but there's a whole mental side, focus side, flow side of programming that's

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.160
honestly both important and kind of interesting, right? If you get it right, it makes a big

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.840
difference. Yeah, for sure. So looking forward to talking to you about that stuff and everything

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.280
else. But before we jump in, though, maybe tell the world who you are. Introduce yourself just a

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.760
bit. Absolutely. So, hey, Chris Ferdinandi. I'm a web developer. I have ADHD, which is a big part

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.920
of what we're talking about today. For the last decade or so, I have been focused on building

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.800
all things front end. Early in my career, I felt like I couldn't get anything done. But since then,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.400
I've discovered a whole bunch of systems and strategies that have let me turn my ADHD from

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.040
sometimes a liability into occasionally a superpower. So I've been talking to folks

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.280
about tips and tricks for doing that. When I'm not talking about ADHD, I'm creating courses

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.080
and workshops. I publish a couple of daily newsletters, speak at events, and I work with

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.200
some really cool clients. Fantastic. And you say you're a web developer. What's your tech stack?

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.440
And we're not here specifically to talk Python, but you know. Yeah, so for me, it's actually,

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:58.160
it's almost exclusively front end. So HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I occasionally reluctantly dabble in

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.520
the back end, primarily PHP, because I learned web development through WordPress. Although as we were

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.200
talking about pre-show, I actually had the opportunity recently to work on a project

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.000
for NASA, of all places, which was really cool, where Python was the back end. And I was tying

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.760
into some back end APIs with some JavaScript stuff, which was really fun. Really great to

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.360
work with. Super performant. It was a real joy to work with. That's fantastic. Yeah, I recently had

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.040
kind of an experience with that, maybe a year ago, with Lauren, the guy who built our mobile apps.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.360
That was all in Flutter. And it was like lots of back and forth. Now we got to make the API do

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.680
this. And it's just super fun to work that way. If you have good people on both ends, I guess.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.720
Absolutely. And it was one of the things where I knew a little bit about the back end,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.560
and the back end guy knew a little bit about the front end. So we could talk to each other,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.000
but we were not experts at each other's thing. So it worked out really well.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.680
That sounds familiar. So front end stuff, you got frameworks that you work with. Are you a

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.640
view person? Are you a React person or something else?

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.120
Anti-framework feels a little strong. Earlier in my career, I was anti-framework. These days,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.480
I am, I'd say, framework reluctant. A big part of what I advocate for folks is that on the front end,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.720
there is a simpler, easier way to build things often that involves just using what the browser

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.520
gives you out of the box. A big part of that for me is that if you're a back end person,

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.120
while the tools you choose do matter, your front end users don't often pay as heavy a tax for those

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.200
choices. But on the front end, every... Sure. Unless it's really slow or something,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.440
but as long as it runs fast enough, they don't care.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.240
Exactly. But on the front end, every kilobyte that gets shipped is a kilobyte. The user has

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.360
to download, the browser has to parse, and the front end is just such an unpredictable and

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.920
unforgiving environment. Unpredictable is the word.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.360
Right. Yeah. You really don't know what you're going to get. So I try to advocate for what I

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:54.480
think is maybe a little bit more simple or resilient way of building things for the browser.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.680
And I guess a little bit of a dinosaur in that regard.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.840
I love it. And I was just thinking, honestly, thinking about ADHD,

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.640
front end stuff, I feel like generally JavaScript front end stuff makes me feel like I have ADHD

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.160
just from the... "Pay attention to this. No, now this. Stop paying attention. Now this."

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.000
Like, "Oh my gosh, I can't focus." The velocity of change, and not just change,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.760
because it's great that new stuff's coming out. The fickleness, I think, sometimes of the people

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.440
who use the tools is really jarring, where a thing that is the right way to do something today

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.680
is considered obsolete six to 12 months from now. That can get really frustrating.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.960
As someone with ADHD, I think it's a big part of why ignoring a lot of that stuff is so appealing

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:44.240
to me. Because when you focus on web standards, even though new stuff comes out, the old stuff

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.320
continues to work just fine. And you don't have to throw out a whole mountain's worth of knowledge

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.960
every 12 months. So that's been really helpful as well.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:57.680
Obviously, I know the term ADHD. I know kind of what it means. I don't have a real good sense for,

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.040
in reality, what it is. Be a person with ADHD rather than just, "It's hard to focus sometimes."

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:06.000
Or your thoughts wander or something. Let's go with that.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.560
Yeah, for sure.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.440
Yeah, I'm sure that it is. So let's start there.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.800
Yeah. So ADHD is actually a really terrible name for what it is. So ADHD stands for attention

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.840
deficit hyperactivity disorder. But people with ADHD don't actually have a deficit of attention.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.920
I think it seemed that way in the 80s when the term was coined, because the most stereotypical

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:33.520
ADHD person was really hyperactive and kind of all over the place and poorly focused on things.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.800
But it's actually an executive functioning disorder. And one of its hallmark features

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.400
is that you have trouble regulating your attention. So sometimes that means

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.480
you've got 18 things going on in your head and you can't focus on any of them.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.200
Other times, it causes this other phenomenon called hyperfocus, which is a little bit like

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:58.480
if you go into the zone as a developer, except way more intense. And you can't usually control

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.520
what you're hyperfocused on. So sometimes it's something really useful and awesome and what

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:07.360
you're supposed to be doing related. And then other times it's like, "Hey, I've got all these

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.160
important things to do, but I can't stop Googling stuff about RVs and campers because that's

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.720
currently what I'm really obsessed with and my brain won't let me think of anything else."

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.600
Yeah, yeah. It's summertime. Why not be obsessed with that, right?

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:25.920
There's a whole bunch of other things that can be around ADHD, a little bit like autism.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.680
ADHD has a spectrum of symptoms. Not everyone who has it has all of them. Everybody's ADHD

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:38.400
experience is a little bit different, but it can include things like having more severe emotional

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:42.560
responses to things than someone neurotypical might. Along with that, there's this other thing

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:50.400
called RSD, rejection sensitivity dysphoria, where a perceived slight you will take much more deeply

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:55.760
and personally than a neurotypical person might, usually in a way that is out of scope for the

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.200
actual size of the thing that happened to you. And these are things I didn't learn about some

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.960
of this stuff until in the last few years. I knew I had ADHD since I was a kid. I was that

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.640
stereotypical really hyper kid. And I always just thought that's what it was. And then about four

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.640
or five years ago, I started hearing more about some of the newer research and discovered all

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.480
these things that I thought were just weird personal failings about me were actually ADHD

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.840
related. Interesting. Okay.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:23.360
Yeah. Another one is time blindness. So ADHD folks often just literally cannot perceive time

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.000
accurately. Sometimes it feels like it's going by really fast. Sometimes it feels like it's going by

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.880
really slow. In both cases, it doesn't feel like it actually is. And I know everybody experiences

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:40.640
that to some degree, but for ADHD folks, it is much more often, usually all the time.

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.880
You can imagine if you work in a situation where you need to make accurate estimates on things and

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.680
accurately track your hours, that creates some unique challenges there. And then the other thing

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:55.360
with ADHD is you're not always hyper. So there's three subtypes, inattentive, which is exactly what

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:02.000
it sounds like where you have trouble regulating your focus. The other one is hyperactive. And

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.600
that's actually... So the impulsive variant is what used to be called ADD way back in the day.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.160
Now it's just all ADHD with three different kinds of variants. And the other one is hyperactive or

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.200
impulsive, which is I think what most people stereotypically think of as ADHD. And that

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.720
doesn't often appear without also having that inattentive, "I can't regulate my attention" bit.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:27.840
And so many, many people have what's called combined subtype, which you're hyper and you

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.520
have trouble regulating your focus. I'm blessed with that kind. The inattentive variant is far...

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:37.360
I'm rambling and I'm sorry, it's one of my superpowers. The inattentive variant is both

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:44.080
more common in women and far more underdiagnosed because it doesn't show up with the hyperactivity

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:52.160
and so it's way less obvious. And so historically, they thought ADHD was primarily like a guy thing.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:57.360
And I think it's becoming a lot more obvious that many more women have it than previously

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:02.960
thought. They just don't usually get diagnosed because they don't often show the hyperactivity

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.760
part of it. Right. They're not running around the classroom or something along those lines.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.360
And you're like... This also led to that whole thing in the 80s of like, "Oh, it's overdiagnosed.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:19.120
That's just boys being... Boy, just all the stuff around that." So anyways, that's... I don't even

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:24.480
want to say a nutshell because that was very long-winded, but that's the high-level overview

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:32.960
of what ADHD is like. Yeah, it's fun. Except when it's not. No, I'm sure. Well, it sounds like some

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.200
of those things are probably annoying when you need them to not be there, right? Like,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.400
if times feels like it's going super slowly, but it's not. And you're now like, "Oh, this hour is

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.640
like utterly dragging on." But you can also use it for the powers of good, right? One thing I

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:54.240
forgot to mention, one of the root biological aspects of ADHD is that our brains don't produce

00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:00.080
as much dopamine as they should. And so a majority of the symptoms associated with it are related to

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.920
like a dopamine shortage. So even like I recently learned that your brain's ability to perceive time

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.840
is actually related to how much dopamine you have, which I thought was like a TikTok of like you

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:15.840
receiving dopamine is almost like a time flow, right? And so a lot of the time flies fast when

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.880
you're having fun as an ADHD person even more intensely because that dopamine your brain

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.040
wouldn't normally be producing enough of gets ramped up when you're excited or you're enjoying

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:30.560
yourself. Like a desert, a dried up desert river versus when the monsoons come, it's like raging,

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:36.160
right? Exactly. Yeah. So there's no normal time for me. It's either moving very slowly or flying

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:42.560
by for better or worse. So I don't know how much personal experience you can bring to this really,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.520
but Jazzy out there asked, "Do you think Python is a good language for devs with ADHD?" It's a

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.440
great language to get stuff done quickly. It doesn't have too many symbols or distractive

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:57.920
other bits to it. For sure. So I generally think Python, yes. Programming in general

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:04.880
is a great profession. One of the things I'm finding is that ADHD folks seem overrepresented

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:11.200
in development. I would agree with that. Yeah. I believe a lot of that has to do with the tight

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.680
feedback loop you get with coding where you write some code, you run it, a thing happens or it

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.400
doesn't. And you get that immediate, "It worked. It didn't," kind of feedback loop, which triggers

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.680
the dopamine thing in your head and then causes you to really start digging into it. To answer

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:31.840
Jazzy's specific question though, even though I teach front-end stuff over at GoMakeThings.com,

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.480
I have so many front-end students who are like, "I wanted to learn back-end language." And I went

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.520
with Python because it's really, really clear and there's a lot of, "This is the correct way to do

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.120
things," whereas JavaScript, anything you want to do, there's at least three different ways you

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.040
could do it and none of them are inherently better than the other. And there's four frameworks that

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.560
came out this week to help you do it. Yeah. So I probably, I don't have enough

00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.160
Python experience to accurately say, "Yes, that's the right one." But I think programming in general

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:07.760
is a profession or hobby, if you just want to do it for fun, that plays well to the ADHD mind.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:13.200
It can trigger that time is flying by really fast because I'm, if not enjoying it, at least very

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.760
engaged in the activity. And it can make what would feel like work for a normal person, feel

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.320
like a really enjoyable, fun thing that you can't get enough of. There are downsides to that too.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.440
Like you could go through like an eight-hour, like just coding bender and find that you haven't

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:32.240
eaten, used the bathroom, gotten up to stretch in any way taking care of yourself because your body

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.120
just didn't let you know. Yeah. Well, I've had those experiences as well. And I don't know if

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:43.600
there's some aspect of ADHD or if it's just, I just got really focused, but I've certainly

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.640
gotten up and I'm, "Why is it dark? How is it dark? Gosh, I am hungry. I'm going to have to

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:54.880
deal with some of this stuff." Yeah. The thing, so that hyper-focus for ADHD folks, I heard,

00:14:54.880 --> 00:15:00.240
I had an old coworker who used to refer to that as weaponized ADHD. So if you can get yourself into

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:07.440
that state often, you can be like way more productive than your peers. The problem is you

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:11.600
can't always like force yourself into hyper-focus. There's no like, "Oh, I just flipped the switch

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.600
and I'm there." Right? So you will have periods of intense productivity. And then you might have

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.280
some periods where you're less productive than both your average and the average of your coworkers.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.720
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by Posit, the makers of Shiny,

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:32.960
formerly RStudio, and especially Shiny for Python. Let me ask you a question. Are you

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.920
building awesome things? Of course you are. You're a developer or data scientist. That's what we do.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:43.040

and deploy all the data products that you're building using Python. People ask me the same

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:53.520
question all the time. "Michael, I have some cool data science project or notebook that I built.

00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.960
How do I share it with my users, stakeholders, teammates? Do I need to learn FastAPI or Flask

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:05.120
or maybe Vue or React.js?" Hold on now. Those are cool technologies and I'm sure you'd benefit from

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.080
them, but maybe stay focused on the data project. Let Posit Connect handle that side of things.

That's talkpython.fm/posit. The link is in your podcast player show notes. Thank you to the team

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:53.360
at Posit for supporting Talk Python. Depending on your work situation, that can lead to some

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.280
uncomfortable conversations where it's like, "Hey, you did really great last quarter and

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.840
this quarter you can't seem to get anything done. What's going on?"

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:06.400
I can see that. Do you feel like the folks with ADHD, they're more susceptible to maybe the

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.640
fluctuations of those two things from a sort of flow state to like, "I'm not feeling it, but I

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.600
got it. I got a job. It's time to just grind it until I feel it again." Do you feel like those

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.720
fluctuations are wider? Like you're less productive when you feel it less and you're maybe even more

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:25.840
productive when you're in the game? The other piece of this that's really tough is so where

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:31.360
a neurotypical person might be like, "Man, I'm not feeling it today, but I'm not gonna keep working

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:37.520
here if I don't do the thing." Right? Yeah. ADHD person will go into like this almost like freeze

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:42.640
state. Yeah. Okay. And I think that's actually the official psychology term for it. But you can stare

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.920
at your screen for eight hours, not get up and you won't type a line of code. You'll just be like

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.800
trying to... Just the inertia of getting started is really, really tough. It's like writer's block,

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.560
but... It is. Yeah. That's literally... It's like writer's block, except your brain just will not

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:01.440
will your body to do what it needs to do. Yeah. And so one of the things... So over at

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:09.200
ADHDforthewin.com, I've been writing a lot about my ADHD experience and some tips and

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.160
recommendations on how to get around a lot of this stuff. And one of the things that I and a lot of

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.560
other folks have found is that traditional productivity advice just does not work for

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:26.720
most folks with ADHD. So if you're a proponent of getting things done or some of those other

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:31.440
systems, a lot of times what they'll tell you is start with your biggest task and get that done

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.120
first. That way it's out of the way. Big tasks trigger massive overwhelm in the ADHD brain if

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:41.920
you're not already like, "I cannot wait to chew this task up and spit it out because I'm so

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:46.320
excited about it." Right? And sometimes even then. So one of the things that I wrote about recently

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.720
was that I actually think folks should start with their smallest task first, because the most

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.720
important thing is getting moving. You're almost like this big rock and you've got a lot of

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.480
inertia. And right now that inertia is telling you, "Stay right where you are." Once you get

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.200
rolling, sometimes you can move yourself into the state where you become difficult to stop.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.000
So the most important thing is just start doing something that moves you in the direction of work.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.880
So maybe go for the small things, right? Because they're easy wins. You get that dopamine,

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.720
like prime the pump sort of.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:20.240
Exactly. So for me, a lot of times I start my morning off by writing my daily tech article,

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:24.400
because they're really short. It's one of those things where it's like a habit for me now.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.040
And it gets me, I'm at a desk, I'm typing, and I've produced a thing and I shipped it.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.880
And now I can get on with the rest of my day and I'm in work mode. And if I have a day where I

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:40.080
have a meeting in the morning and I don't get to do that, it will derail me for literally hours.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.080
That actually happened to me this morning. Actually, I had a client meeting and it was

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.600
the first thing in the morning. It was a really great meeting. It was super productive, but I

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:53.920
didn't ship anything. And so then when the meeting ended, I was really underproductive for about two

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.760
hours. I just kind of stuck, not able to get going again.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.560
Interesting.

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.680
Interesting and annoying. Also very, very, very annoying.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.960
It is super annoying. However, knowing, at least awareness of that is pretty interesting.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:13.360
So this is, I guess, a nice segue here, Michael, is that one of the big things that I advocate for,

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.440
while I admit that ADHD has a lot of challenges, like the one I just described, I'm also someone

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:22.400
who is ADHD positive. I don't think it's like this thing I have to deal with. I guess in a

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.920
manner of speaking it is, but it's not like, "Oh, this has ruined my life."

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.360
And so a big part of what, "Here's why I can't do anything with the rest of my life."

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.560
A big part of what I advocate for is working with your ADHD instead of against it. So I know

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:39.440
that that is a thing that happens. If I feel that I'm in one of those moods where I just can't get

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:44.080
moving, no amount of staring at the screen is going to change that. What is going to change

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:49.840
that is doing a handful of other things that usually involve not using my brain at all.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:53.600
There are a whole bunch of activities that will produce dopamine in your brain,

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.240
and that usually helps. So drinking coffee or soda or something with caffeine in it.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:04.320
The core mechanism by which most ADHD medicines work is by either making your brain make more

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:09.120
dopamine or stopping your brain from absorbing the stuff it does make so that more of it floats

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:15.360
around. Exercise, literally just getting exposure to sun. So I, now that I am old,

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:18.960
I've started gardening, which gets me like two for one. So I'll go outside,

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.400
I dig some holes, I move some heavy, like literally heavy rocks around,

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.960
gets me going, I get some sun. I don't have to think, I'm just using my hands.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:32.320
And then I come in and I will get like eight hours worth of work done in about three or four hours,

00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.240
because I'm now I'm ready. That's awesome.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.600
It's really like a big, a big part of the ADHD experience is learning to listen to your body

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.040
and just step away. Like staring at a screen is not going to help you.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.440
Not that you're weak for stepping away. It's not, your persistence is not necessarily going

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.720
to help you if you can't sort of reach, reset a little bit. I think that's, that's true for a lot

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.760
of people. For me, I don't know if it's the same thing. Probably going to say that a lot this

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:04.000
episode. But for me, one of the things that I've tried to embrace that sounds familiar is inspiration.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.840
I find that if I'm really psyched to work on something, or I'm just like,

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.680
I really don't want to do this, but I got to get it done. There's like a 5x difference in

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:17.200
productivity for me. And so if, if I, it's like, I'm an adult, I should be able just to pay

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:22.400
attention. And it's like, there's a, it's a right thing. No, no, it's ridiculously out of whack.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:27.760
And so I can find if, if I can just, okay, now is not the time for that. This afternoon might be the

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.120
time for that. What else can I do? Maybe, you know, maybe I'll go for a ride in my motorcycle

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:36.480
for an hour in the mountains and get some sun and come back sort of reset, or just, just grind on

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:42.000
email or, or stop grinding email, whatever it is, like just change that up and try to sense the

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.200
inspiration or the lack thereof in my brain for some something, and then try to ride that wave

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.960
when I see it coming, you know, one of the things that you touched on a couple of times brought up,

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:57.120
Hey, I do that too. So the thing with ADHD is I could describe a whole range of symptoms and most

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.560
people will be like, Oh, that happens to me sometimes. And it does because most ADHD symptoms

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:08.560
are things that everybody experiences sometimes. And so kind of the, the difference between I have

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.760
ADHD and don't have ADHD or what would lead you to have a doctor be like, yes, you have it.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:19.280
It's usually a, like a measurement of like how often and how many of these things you experience

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.760
on the regular. When you get diagnosed, there's a whole set of questions you have to answer.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.760
And the doctor adds up a bunch of numbers. And if you hit a high enough number, they're like,

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.880
yeah, you probably have ADHD. Interesting. Okay. So kind of like,

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:36.160
if you ask somebody, have you ever felt like down in the dumps? Have you ever felt today is hopeless

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.400
or whatever? Like almost everyone's going to have a day where they, yup, today is hopeless,

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:44.240
crashed the car, did this and whatever. But that doesn't mean you're necessarily have depression.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.880
Right. And like, for sure. And so the questions will be like, you know, how often do you have

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:53.200
trouble? I'm just making this up. How often do you have trouble paying attention to something

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:57.920
if you're not interested in it? Right. And it's like occasionally, always, you know, like, and so

00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:02.320
you'll have a bunch of those questions that are basically rewordings of questions you already

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:07.520
answered to account for like bias in yourself. And then you get a number, like each column has a

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:14.000
number of the doctor adds it up. And if you hit the minimum number, you've got ADHD. Basically.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.080
Yeah. Got it. There are self-assessments that you can do too, by the way, if anybody's listening.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.960
Yeah. I wonder if I have ADHD. A psychiatrist who diagnoses you will be able to prescribe

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.400
you medication if that's something you're interested in. But if you just think you

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:31.520
might have it as a first step, if you head over to ADHD for the wind.com/talk python,

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.480
I have a bunch of resources and one of them is, oh, how do I know if I have ADHD? I got a link

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:41.840
to that self-assessment there. So you can kind of dig in and find that. Yeah. You put together

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.280
some proper, well that way, you know, just a proper stuff for the show that we're going to

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.080
talk about a bunch of stuff. If I missed anything that we talk about, I'm going to go back and

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.920
update this later. I just want to make sure folks have what they need. Yeah. That's awesome. I'll

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.600
definitely put that in the show notes for folks and people will sign up for your newsletter.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.600
There's a lot of daily tips and we can maybe riff on those a little bit before we get to that

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.000
though. You talked about meetings and I think meetings, I just saw where, gosh, I can't remember

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.800
where it was. I think it was the Atlantic.com Atlantic, the publication. And it said something

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:15.280
to the effect of like white collar work is just meetings now. I don't think that's 100% true with

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:20.880
development, but you know, it's a lot. And I think it's, it can be a challenge and I think it can be

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:25.280
especially a challenge for people with ADHD. One thing that I read that connected pretty well with

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.520
me is Paul Graham's maker schedule, manager schedule. I don't know if people have read this

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:34.400
before, it's from 2009, but I think it's still, it's probably more relevant than ever. So email

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:39.040
me that Paul Graham is great or terrible. I'm not trying to promote the guy or nothing. Just I know

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.120
VCs always get a lot of reactions, but this is pretty interesting saying that like, look, there

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:49.120
are people whose job it is to have meetings and to them, they see blocks on the calendar as, well,

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:53.440
here's another part of my job that I can do. And for the rest of us who are trying to write code

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:58.320
and focus, this is a disruption. And you talked about how it can really derail like half a day for

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:02.480
you. So first of all, how's this, are you familiar with this and how's this idea sit with you?

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.240
If I weren't on your show, I'd probably be one of those folks emailing you about Paul. So I'm

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:09.840
going to, I'm going to not comment on the article specifically, but what I do want to talk about,

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.640
let's put it away. Yeah. But what I do related to that, I don't know that I have strong feelings on

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:22.320
like makers versus managers and whatnot, but what I do, what I do know is that task shifting is

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:29.600
particularly difficult for ADHD folks, largely because it's so difficult to get into that focus

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.240
period. Like you think about a neurotypical developer gets interrupted from focus and it

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:40.560
takes them a little bit to get back into it. It is way more intense for the average person with

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:46.160
ADHD. So they create this effect that I've heard described as like a temporal dead zone, where if

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:52.240
I finish a task and I have a meeting 30 to 60 minutes from when I finished that task, I will

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:57.520
not start another task. Because if I do, I know that by the time I actually get up enough, like

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:03.040
momentum that I'm doing the task, I'm going to get interrupted. And that's either going to, I'm

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.840
going to miss the meeting, which used to happen to me constantly, or I'm going to get annoyed that

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:12.000
I have to stop. And the whole time I'm in the meeting, my brain will be fixated on the other

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.480
thing and not the meeting. I won't start a new task. So I've got this whole block of time that

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:23.360
gets eaten. And then when the meeting ends, now I've got this long on-ramp to get shifted back

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:30.320
into my next task after the meeting. So meetings are bad for developers in general. They're

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:35.200
extraordinarily bad for folks with ADHD. And one of the things I talk about is some strategies you

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:40.000
can use to try to, you can't always make it work, but I used to employ a ton of strategies when I

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:46.000
had like a day job to prevent myself from getting booked in midday meetings. I don't mind them at

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.480
the beginning of the day. I prefer them more in the afternoon when I run out of like developer

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:57.680
steam, but a meeting at like 11 or two in the afternoon just destroys my day. I hear you. Yeah.

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:02.080
Where I was going with that article is what I've ended up doing is I have just certain days blocked

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:07.040
off where those are no meeting days. And that's because I have the flexibility for it. And you

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:11.760
know, you're doing this stuff independently now, not at nine to five. Is that right?

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.360
Yes. But even when I was at a nine to five, I used to do stuff like that because you just,

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:20.640
you gotta. Depending on the culture you're in, like some places are just full of excess meetings

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.920
and it becomes very necessary. Your job is to go to the meetings. I mean,

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:28.000
there's the whole joke, right? About like this meeting could have been an email.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.400
I have found that some companies are worse at that than others. Some environments I've been in,

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:37.440
they're really cool about async communication. Other places like the de facto is just block

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:43.200
time on people's calendar. And that is awful. I don't know where this social expectation that

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:48.000
you could just block time on someone's calendar at any point for any reason came from, but it's

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.600
awful. Exactly. I'm going to reach out. I'm going to grab some time with you. It's like, hold on.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.680
That's just open-ended. Yeah. I found that article. I'll link it. A white collar work is

00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:01.920
just meetings now. It's interesting. Yeah. So good blocking time, I think is a great strategy.

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:07.840
I guess one tangential thing here, because it's not just meetings, right? It's if you're in office

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:13.840
and you're in an open office environment, the pop-in is an absolute nightmare if you have ADHD.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:18.080
I'm sure you've seen before, Michael, articles about how open office environments are bad for

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.400
productivity just generally. Again, it's one of those things worse if you have ADHD.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:29.200
If you're on a remote team, sometimes there's a culture on Slack or Discord that replicates that

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:34.400
open office environment pop-in where you're expected to just always respond quickly on those

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:39.360
tools. So there are two paths you can take. If you have ADHD and this stuff is messing with your day,

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:44.400
you can either ask for forgiveness instead of permission and just take what you want.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:50.000
For a long while, I had this thing where I would just turn off Slack and I would check it like

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.880
two, maybe three times a day. And if someone really, really needed me, my manager had my

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:59.600
cell phone and he could call me if it was super, super important. Same thing with email,

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:05.040
that kind of thing. So that's one path. The other path is you can have a conversation with your

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:10.800
manager. The laws around this vary from country to country. But in America specifically, where I live,

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.360
the Americans with Disabilities Act requires companies to provide reasonable accommodations

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:21.760
for disabilities. And ADHD actually qualifies as one. So you can say things like, "I need to be

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:26.160
able to work from home," or, "You need to give me a private office where the team lead who keeps

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:30.480
shooting Nerf darts at my head can't do that anymore." Or, "That's a real story that used to

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:36.400
happen to me in a previous employer." My gosh. Or, "I need to have days where I don't have meetings."

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:41.920
Or, "It would be really great for me if more of our communication happened asynchronously." Or,

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.440
"If you ask me to do things, I need someone to follow up in writing with that or I'm going to

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:50.720
forget." There's a whole series of things you could ask for. I have a list of accommodations

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.560
over at my site as well that I'll make sure ends up in the cheat sheet I put together for this

00:30:54.560 --> 00:31:00.240
episode. But yeah, asking your employer if you feel comfortable can be a great thing to do.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.720
I am at a point in my career where I feel very comfortable having those conversations. And I

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.520
bring it up with clients. For the last four or five years of my working career, I brought it up

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:16.720
with my employers, any of my managers. I would bring it up in job interviews. But I am a cisgendered,

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.520
heterosexual, white dude with a whole lot of professional experience. And I have talked to

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:26.400
more junior developers, people who are LGBTQ, people who are minorities. And they have all

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:32.240
told me some version of, "I already feel like I'm under more scrutiny because of my gender,

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:38.240
my skin color, my identity. And I don't want to give my employer another reason to look at my

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:43.360
work more closely." I'm realizing as I'm saying this, I fully acknowledge that I'm in a privileged

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:48.800
position to be able to do that. But if you feel comfortable, it can, in the right culture,

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:51.760
make your life at work a lot better and a lot easier.

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.040
I totally agree. Do you feel like the work from home stuff been a boon?

00:31:55.040 --> 00:32:03.200
It has for me. I have also talked to some ADHD folks who they feel like it doesn't have enough...

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:07.920
Structure isn't the right word. There's a bit of an accountability that can happen when you're in

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.960
the office where just seeing other people doing work means that if you are sitting at your desk

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:18.320
and you look like you're not doing work, that's bad. So it gives them at least a bit of a push

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:23.360
to start moving. And there is a technique called body doubling where you literally just sit on a

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:28.320
live cam with someone else and co-work in silence together that is supposed to address this.

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:34.080
I find it deeply uncomfortable. I actually prefer to not do that, but I do know some ADHD folks find

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:40.560
it helpful. But for me, I went remote pre-pandemic. I had been remote for a while and it has been the

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:47.040
single best thing for my productivity that I've ever done. Even before 2020, it was a non-starter

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.840
for me for any job I applied for after I had gone remote that I would never go into an office again.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:58.320
I've done that since 2006. And so it's just like, that's how work is for me.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:04.880
Absolutely. I think it was 2009-ish for me. I was hybrid and then I went full and it was just

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:08.960
not without its own challenges, right? Because if there are days where you're not into it,

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:14.800
it's really easy for me to then not do anything. And that's fine every now and then. But if it

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.560
happens too much, you can find yourself in a situation where you've got a big backlog of work

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.960
that just didn't get done and that's bad. But yeah, on the whole, I would say it's been a huge

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:28.000
blessing. It's not a problem to focus. It's not a problem. There's too many distractions. Over

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.640
there is my sim racing machine. If I'm feeling like I can't, I just get up and go do that instead.

00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:37.520
And then eventually I do that half the day. If that were how work from home worked for me, I could

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:42.800
see that's bad, not a boon. And so what do you, there's a negative side to work from home as well,

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:45.440
and trying to stay focused and not do the dishes and whatever.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:51.120
Doing dishes, being pulled to do the dishes is usually not a problem for ADHD folks. We usually

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.000
have the other problem, which is, "Oh God, I haven't done the dishes in days."

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.080
Why does the kitchen look like that? How'd that happen?

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.920
Right? No, I know why. I just, I feel a deep shame about it and won't address it. But

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:08.800
the bigger challenge with work from home is if you don't have a dedicated space to do work,

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.880
you can run into some of what you just described. You can also run into a situation where there's

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.640
just a lot of other stuff around you. If there's other people at home, you have a partner who also

00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:22.480
works from home, or you have kids and it's like summertime and they're home. It can be loud. It

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:28.240
can be noisy. It can be distracting. I don't find the pull of other stuff in my house that bad

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:36.000
because I am coding on what is effectively a very expensive gaming and video streaming machine.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.560
And it has enough distractions just on the thing I have to do work on already.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:43.920
So there's really not much else. Yeah. There's really not much else in my house that's

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:47.920
more appealing than the thing I'm sitting in front of to do work on.

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:53.040
That's true. Nothing is as distracting as my phone or my computer already. So I'll just go with that.

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.480
They're right here with me all the time.

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.440
Yes. All the time.

00:34:55.440 --> 00:35:00.800
Yeah. So that part less so. It's more the noise. If you don't have a quiet place to work,

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.640
that can be challenging. But I don't think any necessarily any more so than the office.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.880
It's just you're in basically the same position.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.880
You're in your own open office sort of deal.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.120
Yeah.

00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:14.080
You put together a couple of tools that maybe we could talk a bit about. Building a second brain.

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:18.560
This comes from the book by Tiago Forte, I believe, which I read not too long ago. Pretty

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:23.360
interesting book. There's lots of software to accomplish this. I love Notion and actually

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.120
Anytype is what I've moved away from Notion towards it, which is like similar, which is

00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:30.400
super fun. Open source Notion basically. Yeah.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.760
So I've been using Obsidian.

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:32.640
Anytype.io.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.840
Yeah. I've heard that there's a lot of similarities of those.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:42.000
One thing we didn't talk about when we talked about like symptoms of ADHD. We have, ADHD folks

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.200
usually have a very large hard drive and a very small amount of RAM. So we can only keep one or

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:53.200
two things in our working memory at any particular point. And second brains are great for everyone,

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:58.480
but if you tell me three things, there's a good chance I will have forgotten the first two

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:07.360
by the time I get back to my desk. And so the idea of a second brain specifically for folks with ADHD

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:13.360
is that it becomes the RAM that your brain doesn't have. So any idea that pops into your head,

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:19.680
any task you've been given, any thought, anything that you don't want to forget 30 seconds from now

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.240
needs to get written down somewhere. It can be paper. It can be digital. Both have their pros

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:29.040
and cons. I'm biased towards digital for being able to search, but writing things down seems to

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.720
make stuff stick a little bit better in a lot of folks' heads. Are you trying to memorize it or

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:38.800
you're trying to store it, put it on digitalized? So I think a quick definition for folks, I mean,

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.480
they can imagine what a second brain is, but give people a definition of what this means.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.840
A second brain, and I'm not going to, I'm probably not going to do justice to

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:53.760
like the official definition here, but the idea of a second brain is that it's literally just a

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:59.600
place for you to write down or capture all the things. It's funny, I've read so many different

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:05.920
descriptions of it. And in my head, it always just brings me back to the ubiquitous capture device or

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.960
UCD from getting things done, parlance. I think it's just like a, in my opinion, it's just a,

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:16.560
like a rebranding of that thing. But the idea is you just, you want a place to capture and write

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.400
down all the things you don't want to forget later. It sounds good to me. I, as a description,

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:25.360
I think what I got from reading the book, there's a process for capturing the stuff and filtering it

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.680
and putting it. I don't know if I need any of that. What I need is it's in my mind and it needs

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:35.200
to get written down in basically a place I could get back to it if I, if I want to, or even put a

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:40.160
reminder around it. Just, just put it, like you said, just get it out of RAM, swap it to disk for

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:45.280
a while, conceptually, and you can get back to it if you need. Right. The thing with, cause I know

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:50.560
you mentioned Notion. I like Obsidian. There's a lot of different tools out there. One of the

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:58.960
problems for ADHD folks with most digital tools is most of the tools available today do a lot.

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:05.520
And that is kind of the problem. So I'm going to use Obsidian cause I know it well, but Notion,

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:11.760
having played with it before, is very similar in like capability and what it can do. So I'd look

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:17.280
at a tool like Obsidian, which is markdown notes that you can kind of access and edit through a

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:24.000
GUI and organize into folders and things like that. And it has a plugin ecosystem. And you will

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.720
see similar with like with a tool like Notion, like there are consultants who specialize in

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.640
teaching you how to get the most out of Notion. And you can build these really complicated

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:37.280
workflows where you can tie things from a page into another page and then things show up

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.680
automatically in these different views and you get these graphs. That all sounds really fun.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:46.240
It's amazing. I close this thing in my Kanban board on GitHub, which triggers a thing,

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:50.880
which will move this into this page. And then Sarah gets a notification. Like, oh my goodness.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:55.120
That sounds fun. And that sounds like an interesting challenge. And it sounds almost

00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:01.440
like a game. And if I have a brain that craves dopamine and enjoys kind of gamified experiences,

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:08.240
I'm going to spend hours, days, weeks perfecting my to do system to the expense of doing the actual

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:13.120
things I need to do. And then down the road, I'm going to be like, oh, this is so complicated and

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.560
difficult to manage. This isn't working for me anymore. And I'm going to throw it away.

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:21.040
I'm going to go repeat this process again with something new. I talked to a lot of ADHD folks

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:25.360
who feel like productivity systems just don't stick. And a big part of that is because they're

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.200
they're overcomplicated. I think the thing I found that works best for a lot of for me,

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.600
and I've talked to a lot of folks who have had similar experiences, is simple to do lists.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:36.960
Like everything is a bulleted list. Even if it's like an idea you want to remember later,

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:40.400
it's a bulleted list. It might not be a to do that you have to check off, but it's a bullet.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:47.120
And when I use tools like Notion or Obsidian or even a paper notebook, excuse me, everything is

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:54.560
bullets. I install almost no plugins, no add-ons. The only thing I have is a my day view, where when

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:59.520
I tag things with a unicorn emoji, they show up on my day. That way I can just flag the thing.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:03.120
And I like unicorns because they're fun, but it's just it's the place where these are the

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:08.320
things I need to do today. I can see them all on one page and that's it. I think one of the tools

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.080
I've found that used to work still works really well for me, but it's occasionally a little bit

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:17.920
buggy now. Microsoft To Do, which is their free to do app. I like it because it does less than

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:23.120
tools like Todoist, which does a lot. It's basically just bulleted lists with sub lists

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:28.800
under them and you can flag stuff in this special I'm going to do it today page. And it doesn't have

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:34.320
any of the other stuff, which makes it way less distracting. Sure. I'm a fan of Todoist. Oh yeah.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.080
The only reason I moved away from it is I really like authoring and markdown and I wanted something

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:42.320
that let me do that. Yeah. That's why I like Notion. You just write markdown and it just

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:48.160
becomes magic. Where do you forward slash it? I'm a fan of Todoist, but I try to just not

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:53.120
overcomplicate it. Just kind of have a flow. Yeah. I mean, it's funny I say, I say like,

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.240
Oh, do you use Obsidian or Notion? Just don't make it too complicated, but you could do that

00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:01.360
in Todoist too. Sure. They're all it's that's the, whatever tool you choose, just resist the urge to

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:05.440
over-engineer it. I know it's tough, but like you'll be much happier in the long run. Just put

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:10.480
the extensions down. Yeah. Another thing you gave a shout out to is the Apple watch, which I love

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:17.120
my Apple watch. It is increasingly, it is a second brain for me in weird ways. Like for example,

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:22.080
an hour and a half ago, I was recording a course and I put everything on do not disturb. I'm like,

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:27.120
don't forget to come to the podcast with Chris in an hour and a half. So I just, Hey, set a reminder

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.760
for an hour and 20 minutes. And then I just, I didn't stress it. Like just took the weight off

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:36.720
my brain. I could focus back on the course and then, Oh, it's time to go. Like, all right.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:41.040
My wife is the reason I have an Apple watch. I was very resistant because in my mind, I'm like,

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:45.600
I don't need, I'm already like too distractible. I don't need an other thing chirping at me. That

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.040
sounds like you literally are putting distractions on my arm. I can't get it off. What are you

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.040
thinking here? She was like, please just try it. I think it's going to be really helpful for you.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:58.800
And I did. And she was right. Because before I got the Apple watch, I used to miss meetings

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:04.080
constantly. They would go off on my phone. I would snooze them. And then, or I'd more likely,

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.320
I just dismissed them by accident. And then five minutes later, the meeting would start and I

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:13.200
wouldn't be there. Cause I got sucked back into something else. So having that like right on your

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:19.920
wrist for some reason is a real game changer for me. I set timers for literally everything, laundry,

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:24.960
food that I put in the oven, anything that needs to get done gets a timer. And then the one thing

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:29.280
that I haven't written about yet, but that has really helped is the one place where you don't

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.840
usually have your second brain is in the shower. And I do a lot of thinking in the shower and I

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:38.960
have some of my best ideas and I'll be damned if from the time I have the idea to the five minutes

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.720
later, when I get out and drying myself off, I have already forgotten it happens all the time.

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:47.920
But if you have the watch, you can just dictate a note to yourself or text yourself or do something.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:52.800
And then you have it and you can like do stuff with it later. I used to have an old manager

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:58.720
who literally had one of those like scuba diving chalkboards with the, like the grease pen in his

00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:05.200
shower. So he can write down ideas. This feels like the digital version of that to me, where

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:09.600
you just, you know, like, Hey Siri, send a, you know, write a note that says, and then you're

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:15.680
off to the races. And for all the failings of Siri, that, that actually works pretty well.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.840
Like the few things like set a timer, set a reminder, like they actually work quite well.

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.680
You just hold the crown. And I honestly, the, now that I'm talking about these two things in

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:28.160
parallel with you, I feel like it is sort of my second brain of like reminders and attention in

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.400
a sense. One of two things would always happen to me. I would either over fixate on the thing

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:37.840
so that I don't miss it, or I would completely ignore the thing and miss it. And the Apple

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:43.200
watch lets me do the latter without missing the thing. So I can free my brain to do other stuff.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.240
And I know I'm not going to miss my events, my important stuff.

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:50.240
And people out there who are like, I'm not an Apple person. Why are they like,

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:54.720
you couldn't get a Google wear Android wear and do basically the same thing. I imagine.

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.000
I don't have a lot of experience with those, unfortunately, because I am very big into the

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.480
Apple ecosystem, but I need to stop saying Apple watch and start talking about smart watches more

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:05.760
generally, because you're right. My biggest disappointment with the Apple watch is that

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:11.040
it requires an iPhone to work. I think that's dumb and annoying. It's completely dumb.

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:15.280
But if that's you, if you don't have an iPhone and the Apple ecosystem,

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:19.040
I would look at some of the Android options because I think just like a smartwatch in

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:23.040
general has been a really amazing tool for me. Probably one of the most important in my toolkit.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:27.120
It's so frustrating. I don't want to go down this road much, but I was looking at the nothing,

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:32.560
you know, the nothing phones, nothing. They're super interesting. They're really quite different.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:37.120
I seem to recall this from a few years ago. Let's say they've got some interesting

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:43.040
different ways about like, they've got stuff on the back that will like flash and like communicate

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:47.760
things and swap your own. Or am I thinking of something else? No, that's a, that's framework.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:52.400
So they've got like these, it's like hero graphics on the back that mean different things. If they

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.560
like light up and like, this is cool. I kind of want to play with this stuff, but that my Apple

00:44:56.560 --> 00:45:00.960
watch would basically be dead. Like you can't, I'm like, well, I'm not, I'm going nowhere. I can't

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:04.720
imagine why Apple would do that. It's really strange. I can't. It's so it's so it makes no

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:10.080
sense. It must be an oversight. Right? Clearly. We've got a little bit of time left, maybe 10

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:14.240
minutes. So what do you think about maybe going through some of those daily tips or something like

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:18.640
the idea of them and maybe just pick a couple that you want to just give a shout out to. How's that

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.120
sound? One of the things I'm, I'm in the middle, or I said the beginning of a series on how to get

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:29.760
stuff done when you have ADHD and I'm breaking it into two parts. One of them is like, I'm calling

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:34.240
it productivity.app, which is my, like my approach to getting stuff done. And then the other one is

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:42.560
hacking your brain's operating system. And the hacking your brain's operating system feels like

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:47.440
there's potentially some interesting nuggets in there. I'm looking through the list though. And

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:53.680
I actually think we've talked about most of them. Yeah. That's where just organically they have all

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.320
cause you brought up the Apple watch and that would have been the one that doesn't always get

00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:01.040
brought up, but you brought it up. One other thing though, I will say this happened the other day I

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:05.760
wrote about, but I think one of the things I've, I've come to realize is there are certain types

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:12.320
of work that lend within the development space, which lend themselves better to the ADHD brain

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:19.440
than others. And so I look at something like agency work, agency work can be like a blessing

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:24.960
or a curse depending on the agency. And I know that's again, generally true, but quick definition

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.360
for people who are new to programming or outside of the consulting world agency work. What is that?

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:35.760
This would be like a development agency that builds some sort of thing. Could be a mobile

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.720
app, could be a website, whatever it happens to be for a variety of different clients. So they

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:44.480
have a range of clients they work with and they get contracted and you are a developer on that

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:48.880
team. And I contrast that against being an in-house developer where you're like, I work at

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:55.120
IBM and I manage all of the web properties for IBM, or I build this app for IBM, whatever it

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.960
happens to be. I build the authentication integration between all our internal apps

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:03.280
and keep them running or whatever. Exactly. So this is more like, you're like a bee floating

00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:09.440
from client to client. That can be awesome. If you're the right kind of agency, that means you're

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:16.000
constantly getting variety in clients and work. So you've got novelty and you can just absolutely

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.480
crush it with that kind of work. However, sometimes you have agencies that are like,

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:25.520
we build WordPress sites for ice cream shops. That's all we do. We know it. And you get to a

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:33.440
point where it's cookie cutter. And that is just mind-numbingly boring. It can be easy work. It can

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:39.440
be work that you do very effectively, that you can apply unique aspects of that to each of your

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:44.720
different clients in different ways. But it can also run the danger of triggering the whole,

00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:51.200
"Oh, this is really boring. I can't get anything done" reflex. Agencies often, to 90% of the time,

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:55.440
are really focused on billable hours. So a lot of what you're doing is saying, "I think it's going

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:59.680
to take me X amount of hours to do," then tracking how many hours it took you to do and billing those

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:04.720
hours. And those two things are absolute nightmares for the ADHD brain. So if you find an

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:09.040
agency that does like flat billing, where they're like, "We charge X to build you Y," awesome. Or

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:14.800
they do a variety of different work, can be really awesome. But often that's not the case.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:20.800
So where I find that a lot of folks with ADHD really do their best work is when they are not

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:25.680
time-constrained and the nature of the role is more, "We've got this big, hairy challenge,

00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:29.280
and we're not really sure how to figure it out. We need someone who's really into problem solving to

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:34.960
go research it and tackle it. And you happen to find the problem interesting." Because if it's

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:39.440
just one of those things, you're in trouble. But if it's a big, hairy problem and you find

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:44.560
it interesting, and they're not like, "You have 12 hours to figure this out," that can work really,

00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:49.440
really well for you. Some of the best roles that I've had. You're riding the wave of the deep,

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:53.280
the deep, the super focus, the hyper focus, and just like killing it. Yeah.

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:58.320
It hits multiple things at once. The challenge triggers the dopamine thing. It allows you to

00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:03.280
dig into that hyper focus really, really deep and crush a whole bunch of work and look like an

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:08.000
absolute rock star. It's one of those things too, where once you get fixated on a thing,

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.040
it's all you'll think about. And so you'll just keep pulling at that thread until you've got it

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:17.280
figured out. Yeah. So that can work. That can work really, really well. I don't know where I was

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:20.800
going with this. Oh yeah. We talked, it was a thing I wrote about the other day. That's why

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:24.320
we were talking about daily tips. Yeah. Yeah. The daily tips look pretty interesting.

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:27.920
People would say, "Is that free to sign up for?" Yeah. It's just every morning you get

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:31.520
just a little something in your inbox. I try to keep them short because again, ADHD audience,

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.320
right? But- These are your people.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.560
These are my people. Absolutely. Got it.

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:40.560
Yeah. One of the other things that comes up a lot too is when you should disclose

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:45.120
ADHD to it. If you think you're going to do that, when in the process should you disclose it?

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.200
So do you do it during the interview? Do you-

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.800
Right. Is it your employers? Is it their business to even know?

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:55.440
Yeah. So that's what really important. I had someone ask, "Do I feel like it's unethical

00:49:55.440 --> 00:50:00.240
to have a neurological condition that could impact your ability to do the work and not tell them?"

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:06.400
And I feel very strongly that it is not in any way a problem to do that because it's

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:11.520
none of their damn business. If you legitimately think you're not going to be able to do the work,

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:15.760
that's a bigger conversation. But if it means that sometimes you're overproductive and sometimes

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:19.040
you're a little underproductive, it's kind of a wash. I don't have an issue with that.

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.720
Just the same way that I think someone not disclosing that they're pregnant during an

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:28.320
interview process or they have cancer during an interview process or any other sort of medical

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:32.640
condition that is none of your employer's business is totally fine not to disclose.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:41.280
But so for me, my recommendation is that you either disclose once you've started the job

00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:45.520
and you have identified the areas where the current working environment creates challenges for you

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:51.840
and you need accommodations. Or I will sometimes disclose during an interview process if I'm really

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:56.880
digging the people I'm interviewing with and I feel like we're all vibing. So I was once on

00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:02.320
an interview where I was asked whether my preference is to have regular check-ins with

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:07.040
my team on works in progress or to go off and build for a few days and then reconnect after

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:10.560
a few days. Based on everything we've talked about, Michael, I'm sure you're not surprised

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:15.120
to hear my preference is to ignore everybody for a couple of days and then chat. But I didn't want

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:21.120
to seem like a jerk who doesn't like my coworkers for saying that. So I was like, "Oh, I have ADHD,

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:25.760
so blah, blah, blah." And then I found out the interviewer had ADHD, the other dude on the team

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:30.080
we were going to be working with had ADHD, the manager had ADHD, and they were all the same way.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.360
Right. Awesome. We all agree on this.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:36.560
Right? I got a job offer three days later. It was amazing. So I get best case scenario. You

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:42.800
could find that works against you. But yeah, a lot of it is just a gut vibe thing. There's no

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.400
right answer here. You can disclose early, you can disclose late, you can disclose not at all.

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.360
You're under no obligation to do so. Let's see if we can close up this

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:51.280
episode with maybe see if I can get some more mail.

00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:58.160
Scrum, Agile, paired programming. None of these things sound appealing to me.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:02.800
And when Agile first came out, I thought, "Oh, that's really interesting." I find that in

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:07.600
practice, maybe in principle, it sounds cool. In practice, for me, it's all distracting. It's all

00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:11.040
friction and stuff. What are your thoughts? I don't want to put words in your mouth. I'm

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.120
talking about myself. So how do you feel about these things?

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:20.320
Yes, I agree. I talked recently or I wrote recently about how stand-ups are just productivity

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:25.200
killers for me, depending on when they happen and how they work. So my productivity is variable.

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:30.960
I have days where I will do eight hours worth of work in four hours, and I'll do that twice.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:35.200
So I'll get two or three days worth of work done in a day. I'll have days where I get nothing done.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:38.960
Something like a daily stand-up really plays into this idea that you are

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:44.000
consistently productive every day. And if I have two or three days where I have to at stand-up say,

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.800
"Yeah, I'm still working on that thing that probably should have only taken an hour,

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:50.400
but I can't make myself do it. I look like a jerk. I look like a bad employee."

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.400
Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:55.760
It's setting you up to show how you failed that.

00:52:55.760 --> 00:53:00.880
Yeah. And then that can create this self-esteem spiral of like, "Oh, I'm really bad at this.

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:03.840
Everybody else is getting all this stuff done. Maybe I don't belong here. Impostor syndrome,

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:12.400
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah." Similarly, things like two-week sprints and a lot of those rigid

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:17.520
processes, I get why they exist. I understand that they can work well in certain spaces. I think it's

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:23.280
good to have deadlines on when things are going to show some meaningful progress. But for the way

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:30.640
that I work, I find that having those rigid fixed deadlines creates bad stress for me and doesn't

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:35.440
always align with when my brain is like, "Yes, we're going to crank out a ton of work." I personally

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:40.720
need a little bit more flexibility than those types of systems allow. So it's one of those,

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.040
maybe good for other people, not good for me kind of things.

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:48.000
Yeah. I don't know. And paired programming, how does that fit with people with ADHD?

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:54.480
Depends. If I am having a problem with code and I am just absolutely stuck,

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:58.640
pair programming my way through it can be invaluable. Pair programming just for the

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:02.640
sake of pair programming is a nightmare for me because it makes me feel really

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:08.080
self-conscious about what I'm doing and how quickly my brain processes information and my process.

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:12.640
I like pair programming with other people who need help as well, like in a mentoring capacity,

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:16.160
if they're trying to work through something and they just need someone to guide them,

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:16.960
happy to do that.

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.760
Sure. That's a little more like mentoring.

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:26.000
Yeah. But just classic, I just generally... I know some organizations are really big on,

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.600
"You two are going to work on this feature together." That does not work for me.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:35.200
I've heard people who really love it. They find it very valuable. I'm not trying to take away

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:39.600
from that. This is not one of those, I think it's bad for everybody. It sucks for me. I think it

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.360
sucks for a lot of folks with ADHD.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:44.720
Yeah. I just can't get in a flow if I'm sitting and working with somebody.

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:44.960
Yeah.

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:51.200
I might be having a good time, but it's really hard to reach that really high level of productivity.

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:55.520
So you talked... Let's close this out with a bit of a joke. Okay. Maybe something practical.

00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:01.200
You talked about the time blindness, estimating is hard, agile is all about estimates and stuff.

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:06.400
So I saw this pretty cool article I talked about on other podcasts, Python Bytes,

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.760
basically hard to swallow truths they don't tell you about software engineering, but they have a

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:14.160
really great cartoon in here that says, from monkeyuser.com is actually where it's originally

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:20.080
from. And it's trying to reimagine how you might estimate. It says for better estimates, instead

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:26.160
of points or hours, whatever, we switched to measuring story points too. How many duck-sized

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:30.800
horses you're willing to fight rather than implementing this task? There's no duck you

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:36.720
would fight for because it's so easy, or you'd take on a whole cavalry of small duck horses.

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.080
I don't know. What do you think?

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:44.640
I actually... So I know it's a joke, but I find the stake in the ground comparisons for estimates

00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:49.200
useful. I still don't think I'll always get to an accurate place, but if I say,

00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:52.080
I don't know how long something's going to take. And someone says, well, do you think it would take

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:57.200
20 hours? That gives me an instant grounding of like, oh, that feels too high. That feels too low

00:55:57.200 --> 00:56:03.360
or just right. It's still, in my opinion, a bit of a wild guess. Once you start doing the work,

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:09.200
you will expose things like unknowns that make, oh, we thought this, but based on this other

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:12.000
thing, it's going to take longer, or it's going to take way less, or it's going to take about

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.560
what we thought. But having some sort of grounding, whether it's a number of hours

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:20.320
or horse-sized ducks you'd be willing to fight, I do actually think that's really useful.

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:24.480
It's actually kind of interesting. Yeah. And I feel there's a human nature,

00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:30.480
aversion to negativity stronger than a positivity, right? And this is like, how much negativity or

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:35.360
how much resistance do you feel to this? I kind of think it's a little bit, maybe not idealistic,

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:39.600
but I think it goes in the flow of humanity. So I think it's a funny one.

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:46.720
The one caveat with this is there are tasks that have been on my to-do list for ages that

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:52.560
realistically would only take 15 to 30 minutes that I will put off for ages. Usually they're

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:57.040
phone call related. And I hear this a lot from fellow ADHDers, like making phone calls is just,

00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:02.240
really, I had make an appointment with a psychiatrist to look into getting ADHD medicine

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:07.840
on my to-do list for, I'm not making this up, three years. Michael, this was a 15 minute phone

00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:13.200
call, three years. Because it's not just the phone call. It's the, find a psychologist or

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:18.000
psychiatrist you think you're going to hit it off with, make the phone call, pick a date to go there,

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:22.560
get in the car, drive there, do the whole social awkward introductions thing,

00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:27.840
talk about your feelings. Right? Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of levels of resistance. Yeah.

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:32.000
And the thing that actually got me over the hurdle, I found a psychiatrist who has a,

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.920
you fill out your information, we'll call you. And that was the thing that did it for me.

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:41.120
I don't have to navigate one of these, press three for this, now seven, now enter this. You

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:45.680
entered it wrong. You didn't give me long enough to look it up. So the number of duck-sized horses

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:50.160
I'd be willing to fight to avoid making a phone call, which is actually a relatively easy task,

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:56.240
is much higher than the number I'd be willing to fight to implement my own e-commerce platform.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:59.920
You know what I mean? I'm going to write my own crypto before I make that phone call.

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:02.800
Even though one is objectively way more difficult than the other.

00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:07.600
It estimated, it's a reasonable estimate of the total time, not the active time.

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.240
For sure. So there you go. I think there's something to it.

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.760
All right, Chris, this has been a fun conversation and hopefully helpful for a lot of folks out

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:18.240
there. Let's wrap it up with a call to action. People want to learn more. What do you tell them?

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:21.440
If you want to learn more, you think you might have ADHD, you do have ADHD,

fight me about Paul Graham.

00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:38.000
Not a fight I want to have. I would say all those links and all these things will be in
