00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.000
Do you have kids?

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.160
Maybe you have nieces or nephews?

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.440
Or do you work in a school environment?

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.840
Maybe it's just friends who know your programmer and ask about how they should go about introducing

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.600
programming concepts to their kids.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.760
Anna-Lena Popkes is back on the show to share her research on when and how to teach kids

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.440
programming.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.520
We spend the second half of this episode talking about concrete apps and toys you might consider

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.040
for each age group.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.920
Plus, some of these are fun for adults too.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.920
This is Talk Python to Me, episode 478, recorded August 8th, 2024.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.920

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.440
Anna Lena, welcome back to Talk Python to me.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.560
It's awesome to have you here.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.920
Yeah, thanks for having me again.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.720
Yeah, it's always fun to have you on.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.560
You've got interesting and playful topics.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.640
I think the very first time that you were on the show, I can't remember how many years

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.400
ago, but it's been a little while, was to talk about learning Python through Harry Potter.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.400
Is that right?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400
In the magical universe.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.400
Yeah.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400
I still love that project a lot.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.160
People can find that on GitHub and they obviously can find that episode on talkpython.fm.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.800
But we're back for, I would say, another playful episode in a sense, right?

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.560
Continuing the theme, I'm going to talk about when should you teach kids to program and

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.760
maybe even more importantly, what are some age appropriate resources that spans a good

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.800
chunk of what a kid's life is?

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.600
You know, like a kid, not a kid at 18, I don't know, but lower than that, a lot of resources.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600
Exactly.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.680
So that's going to be a lot of fun.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.880
It has been a while since you've been on the show though.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.000
So just a quick introduction about who you are and what you do for everyone listening.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.960
Yeah, actually not much has changed since the last episode.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.240
I think that was on Python packaging.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.640
I'm still a senior machine learning engineer at a German company called Innovex, where

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.160
I jump from project to project.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.520
I'm currently working at the speech recognition team at Bubble still.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.240
Was that last time as well?

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.240
I'm not sure.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.240
I think so.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.240
I believe so.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.240
Yes.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.240
Yeah.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.240
So that's a really interesting topic.

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.480
And yeah, I love Python.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.120
We have talked about different topics over the years and this time it's on children and

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.280
talk I prepared for PyData and the PyCon here in Germany.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.080
And I was really, it was lots of fun to learn about it.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.080
Yeah.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.080
It looks like you did a lot of research.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.080
I did.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.420
I think it's probably worth pointing out that we both are parents.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.720
And so we have some interest in this topics, you know, close to home as well.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.640
My kids are getting a little bit older for any of this kind of guidance, but still, you

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.400
know, a lot of things I thought about as they were growing up and some of these things we're

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.320
going to talk about I've actually used, you know, before I saw them on your list as well,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.200
which is cool, but yeah, it's a personal topic, I suppose.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200
Yeah, absolutely.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.840
For me, it's also personal because I did not have any coding opportunities growing up myself.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.320
I really want this to be different for children growing up now and my own kids.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.280
That's also a reason why I wanted to do the research so that it would be just different.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.280
Let me know what you think.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.640
I feel like there are social stigmas, like this person should be a coder and that person

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.720
shouldn't be a coder.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.080
They should go do something else.

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.000
And that may or may not be around gender, but often it is, unfortunately.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.560
But when you're six years old, you don't care.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.560
You like games.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.560
You want to play a game.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.560
You want to explore.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.560
Things are interesting.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.560
Right.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.840
And that also has a big opportunity to short circuit these unnecessary influences, I guess,

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.080
depending on different cultures.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.140
And also just having it in your environment.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.600
If there's like a person in your family or your friend circle or even at school and you

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.920
have some opportunity to learn about it, it helps a lot.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.060
For me, it just wasn't a topic ever.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.800
And I still remember my parents when I told them that I was switched to computer science

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.880
in my graduate degree.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.280
They were like, "Are you sure you want to do that?

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.160
Isn't that like very nerdy, techie stuff?"

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.240
And I'm so happy I did the switch, even though it was quite hard in the beginning.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.640
But it's an amazing topic and there's so much cool stuff to do.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.880
It's just not only the nerdy stuff.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.040
It's always got something new.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.400
That's both the benefit and the curse of it.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.280
What you've learned is powerful and helpful, but there's more to learn.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.280
Yeah, always.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.200
But that makes, like, keeps it interesting.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.200
Right.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.200
You never get bored.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.200
Exactly.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.200
Especially in JavaScript.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.200
Okay.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.680
So I feel like as your parents had that thought, you know, probably one thing they may have

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.440
thought, I don't know, obviously I don't know them, but a lot of people would think is that's

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.760
a very antisocial sort of thing, right?

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.520
Like, "Oh, you're going into programming.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.360
That means you're going to sit behind a computer screen completely alone and not talk to people."

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.360
And I think that's one of the misconceptions of programming.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.400
Yeah, absolutely.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:58.080
Even now when I'm working remotely, most of the time I have so many meetings and collaborations

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.680
with other developers and I don't ever feel not part of my team, even if I don't see them

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.940
because we interact so much.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.840
Sometimes they sit on a completely different continent and it still feels very close and

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.920
we do love and we don't only pair code, but we like, yeah, you get to know them well.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:23.360
And it's lots of fun, interesting people that are not the stereotype of coders at all.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.360
Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.740
I bring that up because I think some people listening might be attracted to the show who

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.400
don't necessarily work as programmers themselves.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.600
I can recommend it a lot.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.240
I think it's a lot of fun.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.240
Absolutely.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.240
All right.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.480
Well, we talked about some of the reasons that we're interested in this, obviously,

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.480
but why?

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:47.240
I mean, as people who like programming, we may want to communicate or share that thing

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.400
we like with other kids, with our kids and so on.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.560
But I think programming also can stand in for a lot of more traditional things such

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.480
as geometry and so on.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.480
I think what I like most about it is that you can really make things.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.320
You can see them come alive and it can be a game, it can be something more math related,

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.380
it could be music, websites.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:15.120
You can just create anything that you're interested in and even have so much fun seeing it come

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.120
to life.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.360
So it's not just learning a skill, maybe for a job or your life at home or your hobbies,

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.760
but it's more of like being able to create anything that you're interested in.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.440
And then, of course, you have the obvious advantages like the career opportunities and

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:36.400
lots of skills that are taught by learning how to code that you do not think about in

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.400
the beginning, I guess.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.400
Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.000
The realism or I've created something I can see even though it's still digital and virtual

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.520
and you can't actually touch it usually unless it's like robotic or something.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.580
But that's so much more realistic and interactive than things like, oh, you're going to learn

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:58.540
these axioms and then we're going to teach you how to prove stuff about angles and triangles

00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.700
with these axioms.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.300
It's going to teach you logical thinking.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:07.900
So sit down for the year and we're going to talk about small angles, big angles, diagonal,

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.060
cross connected, all that kind of stuff, right?

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.860
Which is a little bit useful, but being able to work with computers is way more.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.820
And I think it teaches these problem solving and computational thinking skills at least

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.820
as well.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.820
Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.820
And especially what you said, like problem solving, logical thinking that kids, like

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.380
not only adults, but kids especially, they understand that you might have a complex problem

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:33.940
you want to solve, but you can break it down into simpler steps, like what an algorithm

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.680
is actually doing, giving you a step by step path to reaching a goal.

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.220
You can teach that not only by coding also, of course, by just playing and seeing you

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:49.060
want to build this huge Lego piece, but you start building it with little pieces and put

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.100
it all together.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:51.700
And that's also what you have in coding.

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:57.340
You want to reach a goal, you want to program a game or maybe create an animation and you

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.460
understand how to break it down.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.780
It helps us or also kids to make more structured decisions.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.980
I think that's a very valuable skill to learn, not only for coding, but for everyday life,

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:07.980
I guess.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.140
Being able to break problems down and solve them.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.140
It helps.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.140
That's like adulthood right there.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:17.360
What I also find really helpful is one of the skills I looked at specifically is perseverance.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:22.180
Also for kids, they get frustrated so easily and give up and say like, "This is not working.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.180
I don't like this.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.180
I hate this."

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.480
And start throwing their toys around.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.500
At least we are at this stage.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:31.140
Your kids are probably not doing that anymore.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:37.180
But yeah, I think with coding, when you encourage them to keep going, even or especially when

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:41.420
they fail, that they understand that failure isn't something bad, but rather it keeps you

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:42.420
improving.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:49.240
It keeps you going and that you can learn to see challenges or problems at something

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.800
positive and something you can grow with.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.160
I think that's really, really great about coding because you will have that a lot when

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.160
you learn how to code.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.480
Yeah, I absolutely agree with you.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.240
In the problem, this perseverance skill is incredibly important.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240
I agree.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.920
It manifests itself a little bit differently as they get older.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.800
Instead of going, "I dislike this.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.800
These are those toys.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:11.800
Crap.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.800
I'm not good at this thing," or whatever, it's more, "I can't do this.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:16.480
I'm not good at this."

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:20.840
And a really important skill, I think, is not, "I can't do this.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.600
I need to work at being good at this."

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.240
And that perseverance that you learn.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.000
Honestly, I think one of the very most important skills that people can have as a programmer

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.560
or in software development in general is perseverance.

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.560
Like, "Doesn't work.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.560
I read the docs.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.560
Still doesn't work.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.080
I read Stack Overflow.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.080
People were mean.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.080
Still didn't help me.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.560
I worked my way.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.560
And now it works."

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.040
And it's such a cool feeling to work through those things.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.120
But until you learn the perseverance, you just think, "Well, I wasn't good at math.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.240
I must not be good at programming.

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.240
I'm out."

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.240
Yeah.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.040
I think that keeps a lot of children to learn or to like learning things that are hard.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.580
Lots of kids struggle with math and STEM classes.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:05.040
But I think it's often because they feel like, "I don't understand this."

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.640
Might also not be explained in the best way, but they just shut down and say, "Okay, I'm

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:10.940
just not going to try."

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:16.880
And if you understand, and maybe also I know that there's this huge psychological research

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:23.920
on growth mindset that you understand that you shouldn't praise just an outcome, but

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.480
rather the effort that kids try to do something.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.680
They try to improve and put in the work that's just so much more important than reaching

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.280
the goal in the end.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:40.960
We can really help our kids to become more robust and more joyful about learning by teaching

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.280
these principles, for example, through learning how to code.

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.720

Thank you to WorkOS for supporting the show.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.920
Now you did give this topic as a talk at PyData.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.280
Was that PyData Berlin?

00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:58.000
Or was it?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.520
I gave it once at PyData London and at PyCon Berlin and at EuroPython.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.000
Okay.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.560
Yeah.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.200
So the reason I was going to bring that up is you had some really cool pictures.

00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:10.480
Yeah, I know.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.600
You'd come up with like a little persistent kid working away there and stuff like that,

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.080
right?

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:16.880
Oh, I loved them.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:17.760
I loved creating them.

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.240
I used Delhi 3 to create them.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.320
And I spent so much time just playing around with the model and providing it prompts to

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.800
see which images I liked best.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.960
Of course, there were the obvious problems with some of them that the kids had six fingers

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.200
and so on, but still, it was amazing to create these images.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.520
And I love that like the perseverance one.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.680
And we can link the article to my blog later where you can see the image.

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.400
It's just everyone laughs when they see the picture.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.360
Yeah, the pictures are great.

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.160
The pictures are great.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:51.920
All right, let's talk for a minute about brain development and maybe the different stages

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:57.040
that kids go through because there's four or five stages, which then you might map over

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.840
to the different types of resources that we're going to talk about.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.920
Yeah, I think that's a really important topic to consider.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.080
If you want to understand when your child is able to do certain things, then you need

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.600
to be able to understand how their brain develops because our brain matures over time.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.680
It's not fully mature at birth, but quite the opposite.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:20.640
And some regions of the brain take more time to develop and some like vision and hearing

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.560
are quite well developed already at birth.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:30.080
So at certain ages, it does make sense to start coding, for example, from zero to four.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:36.160
And there is not much there for them to really have the cognitive abilities to understand

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.640
computational principles or really sit down and concentrate and focus.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.920
Yeah, for example, at birth, you have quite a lot of neurons already, but just 25% of

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.200
the adult size brain.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:49.920
And when you reach the age of four, you already have 80%.

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:53.440
So it has grown a lot through the first four years.

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:58.000
And you do have a lot of influence as a parent or caregiver, friend, whatever.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.320
Mostly the primitive areas of the brain develop first, like hearing, vision, emotional regulation

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:10.000
starts developing, but really cognitive and executive functions like planning and so on

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:10.800
come later.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:15.280
So I guess zero to four years would be, or birth would be the first stage.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:20.400
And then zero to four years where you have lots of things happening and you can influence

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:27.120
that by positive influences from like responsive caregiving, that you have diverse learning

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.360
experiences and playing with a child.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.720
And then at four years, it starts getting interesting.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:38.240
And that's also where you can start doing things with your kid.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.240
Like, do you want to rather talk about the development first and then about...

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.560
Maybe we should talk about the resources that go with each stage.

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.120
What do you think?

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.440
Yeah.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.160
Yeah, let's do that.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.280
So yeah, I do too.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.440
Since we already reached age four now.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.480
Oh yeah, nice.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:50.720
Yeah.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.160
So at age four, you can teach basic algorithmic thinking.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.080
And you can ask questions like, what would you do to guide a lost puppy home?

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:03.760
Just making them start to think about how to break down problems into smaller steps.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:09.280
But also they have the motor skills at that age and the perceptual abilities to interact

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:12.640
with simple toys that teach the basics of coding.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:17.760
And you open the BeeBot, which is a tiny floor robot, or I guess it's not so tiny.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.320
It's a bee and it has four directions to go front, back, right, left.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:28.480
I think it can remember up to 130 commands and you can press go and program the way it's

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:32.640
supposed to crawl or walk, however you want to phrase it.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:32.960
Yeah.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.520
So one thing you might do with this thing is...

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.840
So this is a little robot that has wheels.

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.720
It looks like a bee.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.920
What you do is you push the buttons like forward, forward, right, forward, left, forward, forward.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:47.040
And you might put out something on the ground, like a little...

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:53.200
Can you make your bee go around this thing and then through this little gate or whatever?

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:53.520
Right?

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.040
Those kinds of challenges.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:00.400
I think even when you purchase them, you can purchase rucks that have certain paths on

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.280
them and so on.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.640
I guess it's a very...

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:02.960
Right.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.560
You can spend a lot of money on these kinds of toys.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:11.760
But maybe as a side note, if you start looking, you will find tons of robots in different

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.640
price ranges.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:18.640
So I guess we will only mention examples, but if you start looking, you will definitely

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.160
find lots of different options.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:20.720
Yeah.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.520
Absolutely.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.720
Would you say that this RoboTurtles game falls into the same category or is that a little

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.200
bit older?

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.920
Oh, I'm not sure from the top of my head if it's older.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.000
What I like about it is that it's a board game.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.880
So I'm always asked about screen-free offers.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.840
So something that you can play without sitting in front of the laptop because screen time

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.560
is just a general huge discussion point.

00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.840
I would have to look up.

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.480
So if I...

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.040
Yeah.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.440
Looking at the box here, it says ages four and up.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.160
So probably.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:48.800
Oh, nice.

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.600
That's really cool.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:49.920
Yeah.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.160
Yeah.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.280
So this one is...

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.760
I think it's almost exactly the same problem.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.000
There is a little bit more to it because there's a couple of challenges in the board game.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.600
So I think we actually have this board game from when my daughter was young.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.760
And you have a little turtle, which is a card and a board, and you can put stuff on the

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:07.200
board like little rocks.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.880
It can't go through.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.280
Maybe there's like an ice wall and it has ability to melt the ice, but it has to do

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.480
that before it can move forward.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:19.440
You get a bunch of cards and you put them in a stack and then you play them out to see

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.320
if your turtle wins the game or something like that.

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:26.400
So this is another pretty good option at that age, especially if you want something not

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:26.960
electronic.

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.880
What I also like about it is that it becomes a family activity that you learn.

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:35.120
That's just in general a very good thing if you want to teach your kids how to code, that

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.960
you make learning a fun activity and playing games, being with them, showing interest and

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:46.640
yeah, having fun doing it as part of gaming or what you do at home, playing board games.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.560
That's just a very easy way then to get started and to get them interested.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:56.320
I should point out like the actual Robot Turtles website has a bad SSL certificate right now.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:00.800
So I'm sure you can find it on like Amazon and other places, but it's...

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.600
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:01.920
Okay.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.800
So what else?

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.880
Another one you talked about is cubelets, but this feels like this might be a little

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.520
bit older.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:12.160
Cubelets, it's, well, you can start early with them, but you can also use them at a

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.600
later stage because you can program them using visual coding languages or one of them may

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.160
code, but you can start quite early.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.280
These like cubelets are small physical blocks.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:28.320
As you can see there that you just plug together and some of them move, some have cameras or

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.320
sensors, and you can build lots of cool, unique robots with them.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:38.400
And if you start looking at demos on YouTube, it's really amazing how cool they can look,

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.360
the end robot.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:42.880
I think one disadvantage of this is that it's quite expensive.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:48.240
So one of these blocks is about 50 euros or maybe $45, $50.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:53.920
So if you want to build big robots and have lots of options, then you need to invest quite

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:54.720
a bit of money.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:54.880
Yeah.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.680
I like that the website says free shipping on orders over 50.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.560
It's like, okay, pretty much anything.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.560
Yeah, I guess.

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:09.120
But I still, I love it because it makes you like be creative, especially having this aspect

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.760
that you can program them later on using Mako.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.600
That's one of the visual programming language.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.760
I think that's the run for Microsoft.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.640
You can keep using them over a long period of time.

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.040
Yeah.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.920
For maybe a mental model for people who haven't seen these in action, because even looking

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.280
at the website, you'd have no idea.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.720
What do I do with these things again?

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.280
Why are they here?

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:31.760
I feel like they should have people to animation or something, but there's these cubes as the

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:37.040
name would imply, but they're almost like Lego blocks that each block is programmable.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.640
And then you combine them into a thing that does stuff.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:40.880
Right.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.000
I think you explained it well.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:42.960
Yeah.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:43.520
Thanks.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.680
So I think that that's pretty interesting, but this is probably in the next stage, right?

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.000
The next stage would be maybe six to nine.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.560
What do you think?

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.120
Yeah, exactly.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.360
I think the next stage regarding development would be around six to nine.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:21:01.280
Of course, you also always have to mention it's this is now for normally developing children.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.280
It's just an average, every child is different.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:08.160
So if you observe your child, you know, which skills develop at what point and what might

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.160
be easier for them, what is harder.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:15.920
So this is not like hard ranges, but yeah, if you start with about six years of age,

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:21.840
you can start using visual programming tools because kids become used to using technology.

00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:23.760
They have a better hand-eye coordination.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:28.880
And also one very important part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, it's like the CEO of

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.480
our brain, has a big growth spurt between five and eight.

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:38.160
And this improves working memory, planning, attention, and all kinds of mechanisms that

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.600
you need to start really sitting down and code.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.680
And you already opened Scratch Junior.

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:50.240
Yeah, and Scratch Junior is, I think Scratch is quite popular, one of the most popular

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.440
visual coding languages.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:56.320
And Scratch Junior is just a simplified version of it for very young children starting at

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.680
five to seven is recommended on their website.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.400
So it has no text, but rather actions like movement.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:10.240
In visual programming in general, you have puzzle pieces to represent concepts like loops

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:15.440
usually, or I don't know, variables, logical expressions, and you can plug them together.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.520
So you don't have to worry about syntax or using the command line.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.280
You just create these programs by putting together puzzle pieces.

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.440
And that happens on a visual interface.

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.600
So that's what visual programming is about.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.880
And Scratch Junior is just a very simple version.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:34.400
I think it's just a free app.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:40.160
You can play on tablet and create little programs where the characters move around and do

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:40.800
things.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:46.000
Kind of like the Bee, but you look a little closer to real programming, but then you see

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.720
the output, right?

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:46.960
Yeah.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:52.240
And you start really using, I guess, these plug-in principles that you have the blocks

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.520
that you put together.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.000
So when you go on to, for example, Scratch or another of the visual programming languages,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.680
you're already, you have knowledge about how it works in general, I guess.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.680
As I look at this website, I was thinking, you know, when I think about coding, I think

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:13.280
about computers, Mac, Windows, whatever with apps, but obviously young kids are way more

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.760
in tune with touch devices like iPads and Android tablets and stuff, right?

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.240
It's amazing how quickly they adapt and learn it.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.200
I think it's quite, sometimes I'm blown away by how young children can already understand

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.880
how to swipe and select stuff on a touch screen.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:34.080
I think actually it probably lowers the age by quite a bit that kids are able to do this

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.680
kind of stuff because these touch interfaces exist in decent ways.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.480
Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.520
Just learning how to type is actually one of the main reasons why you can only start

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:47.440
with textual programming later because typing is hard.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.040
You need to learn how to do it.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.920
Just touching and dragging and dropping is much easier.

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:57.120
When my older kids were very young, we wanted to have them work with things like this and

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.320
just learn how these computers, and they, this predated the iPhone.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.520
Like it didn't exist.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.200
There was no meaningful touch screens that really you would want to use.

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.640
And so we got like, kind of like you get a typing program to learn to touch type.

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.320
We got a mousing program and there was like a little airplane and they had to like chase

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.400
the airplane around with the mouse to learn how the eye hand coordination of mouse and

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.680
then like screen, right?

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.800
When you're three or four years old, like that's not natural, right?

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.200
But touching, oh, they already be all over that.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.880
I think sometimes it's even too intuitive for them that it starts having, like having

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.560
a very huge influence on them way too early.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.400
But I guess that's a different discussion.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.680
Yeah, that's a different problem.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.720
That sends you back to a robot turtle board game.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.920
Yeah, exactly.

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:46.080
This portion of Talk Python to Me is brought to you by us.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.880
I mentioned at the top of the show that we have a wide range of courses focusing on core

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:56.560
topics, such as getting started with Python and advanced ones like APIs, async programming

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.160
and deep diving into Python's memory management and more.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:04.720
But did you know that we have a set of world class apps that you can use in addition to

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.800
our web platform for taking our courses?

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.120
If you're using a tablet or even a phone, apps are clearly the best option.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.440
But there are other reasons to check them out as well at talkpython.fm/apps.

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:21.680
Our mobile apps offer offline playback, which allows you to download portions or even complete

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.640
courses.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:28.080
We hear from users who learn on the way to work on the subway where connectivity is tricky,

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.840
as well as to those who have secure environments that don't allow them to connect personal

00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:34.800
devices or which have limited connectivity.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:39.360
And even though I've done a ton of work to make our video delivery excellent, no matter

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:43.360
your location in the world, there are still places with very slow internet.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.920
Downloading a course and then watching it without pauses is a really great use case

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.640
as well.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.920
The app is 100% free and it includes eight free courses that are a single tap away.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.200
So give it a try at talkpython.fm/apps.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.000
Now back to the show.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.360
A little bit later, we could do...

00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:07.120
Once you start doing this, some kind of programming language, then that opens up a bunch of resources,

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:07.360
right?

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:13.280
So obviously Scratch is sort of the way more full featured version of Scratch and Junior.

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.080
That's pretty neat.

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.080
Yeah, I think Scratch is amazing because it...

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.000
I think for kids, it's great.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.720
I know lots of adults that still use it for some projects where you really want to make

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:30.080
it come alive because Scratch is focused on having really cool, interactive, fun projects.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:37.360
They have sounds, music, you can add graphics and it just offers a lot of functionality

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.760
to create your project, share them with friends.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.760
And there is a ton of resources on learning Scratch.

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.480
And as you can see here, make music, create a story, create a character.

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:51.440
I guess your possibilities are endless.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.560
Yeah, it looks really...

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:54.960
Actually, I didn't realize all the stuff they got going here.

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.680
They have a bunch of tutorials, free coding community.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.560
It's super cool.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.840
Then I guess while we're talking on these visual programming languages, we could talk

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.520
about Blockly, right?

00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.280
Yeah, when I knew Blockly existed, it was also free.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.040
Like Scratch is also free.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:10.640
I guess that's important to mention.

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.600
And Blockly is actually at the basis of most of the other visual languages.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.640
For example, it is actually like block-based languages like Scratch and MakeCode are based

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.440
on Blockly.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.280
Blockly is developed by Google.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:29.840
And with Blockly, I think it's for a bit older kids because it's more low level.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.240
If you can say that, it offers you more flexibility.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:34.720
You see the code next to the blocks.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.520
You see it in an editor, how it actually looks like.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.480
And you could copy paste the code into a normal editor and run it.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:48.800
It's more low level, but also somewhat more sophisticated, the editor that you have it

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.920
more, it looks more like coding to me than Scratch.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.320
Maybe the way to think about it, you say it's more low level.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:28:01.360
I would say each block almost corresponds to a single symbol of code, almost, right?

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:06.400
Like you have a set variable too, then you put another block on, which is the value.

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.320
And then, you know, you've got your visual editor, but then side by side, you have your

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.640
JavaScript or I imagine you could probably see Python or other languages if you, there's

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.240
a dropdown for choosing the output language.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.840
Yeah, you can use JavaScript, Python, PHP, Lua or Dart.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.000
Yeah.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.080
So that's kind of getting a little farther up there.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:27.840
And maybe we could talk a bit about the hardware side, because that's one way that it actually

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.000
can be something you can touch and feel.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.680
And as you interact with these ideas, right?

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.840
I know that that's nothing I ever used, but my brother started using it.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.000
Like I know that he bought a Raspberry Pi.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
You open up the micro bit, which is like a smaller programmable device.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.960
And the Raspberry Pi would be like full-fledged computer in a tiny device.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.960
But yeah, you can learn a lot about hardware and also coding by having such devices.

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.920
And the micro bit has displays, buttons, sensors, and you can program it using make code, one

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.920
of the other visual programming languages.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.880
And I think it's quite cheap compared to other devices.

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:09.520
Like a Raspberry Pi is, I think it's not expensive for having all these abilities or these capabilities,

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:14.240
but the micro bit is, I guess, more affordable for lots of people.

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:14.960
Oh yeah, nice.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.000
There you can see how it works.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.680
And you know what's really interesting is if you go to makecode.microbit.org,

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.960
even if you don't have one of these devices, it comes with a little emulator and then it has

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.320
a virtual micro bit that you can write code against.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:37.120
And it gives you an option as well to choose Python or Blockly or some other way of working

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.240
with it, which is pretty cool.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:38.800
Exactly.

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.040
That's also why it's recommended for children, like officially it's recommended for children

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.040
at the age of eight or older.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:50.560
And Blockly, I think is even recommended for kids starting at 10, whereas Scratch is for

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:51.920
even younger children, right?

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:56.640
They say you can get started at eight and they say what I think, which is funny, they say it's

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.880
up to 16, which doesn't make sense to me.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.480
Why would there be an upper limit?

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.280
But yeah, anyway, you can still use it.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.280
You're 17, you have to do C++ now.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.080
Yes, exactly.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.680
What is great about visual programming is that you can always come back to it.

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.640
It's not that you progress from these robots to visual programming to textual programming,

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:20.400
but you can use visual programming for doing, I don't know, digital stories and you can still

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.240
do textual programming at work.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.200
It's just having all these options now is really nice.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.160
Yeah, absolutely.

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:26.880
Let's see.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.720
We also have Zoomie.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.440
Zoomie is pretty cool.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.240
Let's come back to Zoomie.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:33.760
I do want to talk about something that's like a little bit more real similar to the micro

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:37.280
bit first is many of the things over at Adafruit.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.480
Are you a fan of Adafruit?

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.840
I don't know Adafruit.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:40.640
Tell me about it.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:47.600
So this is a company that creates a whole bunch of small devices like the BBC micro bit that

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.120
runs CircuitPython.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:53.520
There's just tons and tons of things you can buy.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.000
You can buy little sensors and you can buy little displays or whatever it is that you're

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:58.560
looking for.

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:03.200
There's just many, many little ways to make these projects a little bit more than a micro

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:03.440
bit.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:09.120
So for example, you could get one of these ESP32 devices, but it has like a little tiny

00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:14.160
display on it that you can output your text to and it costs $19.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:17.120
Which is pretty ridiculous.

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.600
And they often come with tutorials on how to do it.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:24.320
So if you're into this kind of stuff, this is like a perfect place to go.

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:29.040
Also, there's just so much opportunity to learn even for like being the parent.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:31.680
I would learn so much from doing this.

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:37.280
It would be so valuable to me to learn more about the hardware side of things, especially

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.120
because I would never sit down and buy myself a Raspberry Pi.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.880
I don't know why, but I wouldn't do it.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.160
Just don't find the time.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.120
But if I can do it.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.640
You already have a computer and all that.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.040
Yeah.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.640
And if I can do it together with my children, I think that's just amazing.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.440
It's really cool.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.320
And this is just a general thing about learning with kids.

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:59.760
If you learn together with them, they can also be the expert sometimes, which is amazing

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:00.560
for kids.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:05.600
If they can explain something to you that they understand better, it gives them so much

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.600
joy and helps them develop this passion and love for learning.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.720
I think that's a great thing about learning how to code.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:18.240
That doesn't matter if you are the best coder, but you can just use it as a way to improve

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:18.800
yourself.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.040
Yeah.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:22.960
And once they get that mastery, they're like, "Oh, now I've gone beyond them."

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.480
It's probably a really good feeling.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:30.240
If my kids want to learn how to code early, like much earlier than myself, they will become

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.200
so much better than me so quickly.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.080
Yeah, for sure.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.160
I have one of these little devices here.

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.120
You put it in your hand.

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:39.840
It's like certainly smaller than the palm of my hand.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.680
And this thing manages the DNS and ad blocking on my network.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.440
It was like 20 bucks or something.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:45.840
Yeah.

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.360
There's sort of less playful, more interesting.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:52.480
Also just utilitarian things you can do with these little things.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.280
Yeah, absolutely.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:53.760
All right.

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.040
Back to Zoomy, which is in the same age category, I would say.

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.720
This is like around 10 years or so.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:58.960
Yeah.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.800
But it's more robot-like, right?

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:01.840
Yeah, exactly.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:03.840
It's a self-driving car kit.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:07.760
It's a small car and it has so many capabilities.

00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.080
You can program it using Python and Blockly.

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:16.080
You can even teach it about driving certain ways by providing your own data sets.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.000
So there is a lot of machine learning.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.200
Even you can teach it.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:25.040
It offers so many opportunities or ways to create projects.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:30.240
At my company, we have done quite a few workshops with kids with Zoomy and they love doing it.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.000
And adults love doing it too.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:32.320
Nice.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.040
It's like a self-driving car kit.

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:39.840
So if you wanted to try to, instead of maybe teaching it, you go forward three steps, you

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.880
turn right, you go forward two steps, you turn left, you teach it.

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:46.480
If you see a turn left sign, you turn left or something like that, right?

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:46.880
Exactly.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:47.040
Yeah.

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.160
It can really understand or analyze its environment.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:51.360
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:51.920
Okay.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.600
And you do events with these?

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:54.240
Yes.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.600
That's also maybe advice for people that want to get started.

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:02.640
It's always useful to check out local events that happen at companies that are close to

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.880
where you live or universities.

00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:09.840
They do offer a lot of free, often offer free workshops for kids where you can sign them

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.400
up to learn about robotics or coding.

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:18.560
And it can be like an easy way to get them started if you find it hard to do it yourself.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:18.720
Yeah.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:24.960
I think a lot, at least in the US, there's quite a few programs for like summer teen

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:31.520
programs that do either 3D printing or coding with Lego robots or whatever.

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:33.840
So there's a lot of summer camps and that type of thing.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.080
Yeah.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.440
I guess that's very big in the US and Germany.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.400
I think not so much.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:43.920
Maybe it's growing, but yeah, you can definitely spend a lot of time doing it.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:50.960
I know that like we at our company, we sometimes offer day workshops where you can just start

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:56.320
getting to know about a topic or just play around with things, becoming kids interested

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.760
in the topic in the first place.

00:34:57.760 --> 00:34:57.920
Yeah.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.800
That's really neat.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:03.680
Last in the category of hardware here, you already mentioned it though, is Raspberry

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.360
Pi, which I guess is a little closer to just a real computer, right?

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:07.600
Yeah.

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.440
It's a really powerful device.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:16.400
So it's basically a very small and cheap computer that runs Linux, but you can use it to learn

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.120
coding, but you can also build hardware projects with it, do home automation, learn about the

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.000
Internet of Things.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.040
But it's recommended for kids starting at 11 years, so quite a bit older because you

00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:28.160
need programming.

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:34.640
This maybe also shifts over to the next age range, namely when your kids have typing skills

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:41.520
and also a more well-developed cognitive abilities and the prefrontal cortex, which I talked

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.320
about the CEO of the brain, the development starts to mature and stabilize.

00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:51.520
So planning, organizing, thinking abstractly, all these skills become more fully developed

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:55.440
and you of course need the typing skills to get started with textual coding.

00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:01.280
So at the age nine plus, most of the time you can get started with these things.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:07.520
For example, with like programming Raspberry Pi or just more traditional textual programming

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.080
languages.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.840
The typing skills is pretty interesting, I think.

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:17.840
One that you talked about before, but I think is also super interesting as a gateway to

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.320
this.

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:22.960
This is the best one that I know, maybe people know of others as well, is Code Combat.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.400
You did a podcast episode on that years ago, right?

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.560
This is one of the ones, like my daughter and I both subscribed to this for a while

00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.680
when she was younger.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:36.800
We'd go through and we did, I can't remember, I think she did 30 or 40 code challenges

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.280
through there or something like that, which was pretty awesome.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.560
And I also had the guys on the show.

00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:41.920
Yeah, it's been a little while.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.120
Yeah, it has been, but it's still, I think it's an amazing resource.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.320
So Code Combat is about learning how to code through gaming.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.720
So you play a game from beginning to end.

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:55.280
And while you play the game, you learn to code in Python or JavaScript.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.200
I think there are several languages, but you really do textual programming.

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:04.000
And if your kid likes gaming or this is something that makes it easier for them to get started

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.080
with coding, it's an amazing resource, even though you have to pay for it because you're

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.440
really guided through the course.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.720
You can have lessons.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:17.200
You can even have, I think, teacher lessons once or twice a week, dependent on your subscription

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:17.680
plan.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.840
Yeah, I think there might be a free tier if you tell it you're a student, but you can

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.680
only do certain challenges.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:28.400
Like, for example, see this, there's like a locks here and it says, I think, yeah, I

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.240
have to subscribe to this if I want to do all, if I want to solve all the puzzles, but

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:34.320
there's some of them that you can do for free, I believe.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:38.080
I don't feel like we had to pay at the beginning, but they could have changed the model.

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:39.760
I also played around with it.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:42.720
At least in the beginning, you can try it out for free.

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:46.320
What I really like about this, you know, so if you click on, if you go to this, you click

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.240
on one of the things it says for this challenge, you're going to learn arguments and syntax.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.720
Or if you come over here and you click on this one, you'll say you'll learn while loops

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.360
or whatever.

00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:58.880
But then it gives you just a nice, simple challenge.

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:04.000
So, but what's cool, oh, no, in order to play that one, I got to, can I play this one?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.960
Yeah, here you go.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.360
So you have this character and what's, oh my gosh, it made that very large.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.840
What's really cool though, is when you, it gives you a little hint, but the editor, here's

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.840
what I think is special about Code Combat.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:21.120
The editor is auto-complete like you have never seen, you know what I mean?

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:24.640
So it says, all right, what you need to do is build a fence and you have a hero and the

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:30.240
hero has the ability to say, build at X, Y position, or it could move.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.560
And if I just type the letter D, it'll auto-complete like hero.movedown.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:41.520
Or if I say hero build X, Y, it automatically puts in all the, it's, so if you can type

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:47.280
just a couple of characters, it'll keep the syntax, you know, like the spacing for indentation

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:53.680
and block definitions and all of that kind of stuff is ridiculous for how you don't even

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.760
have to really have the right syntax.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:58.800
You just have to put a little bit of some kind of word in there at all.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:03.840
And it'll, it'll start to write all of it for you, which I think that's the magic here.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:07.920
It's nice that you have this insider knowledge by having tried it out yourself for quite

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.320
a while.

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:12.320
Yeah, it worked way better than other stuff when my daughter was young and I was trying

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:18.000
to teach her like beyond the visual programming things, but it's, it's so forgiving compared

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.240
to, well, here's your favorite editor and you start typing, oh, why won't it run?

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.680
There's three spaces, not four.

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.240
Oh, I see.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.040
You know, all that kind of detail you got to normally deal with.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:30.480
It can be so frustrating in the beginning if you need to learn about everything at the

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.760
same time, like syntax, spacing, brackets.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.800
It's just a lot to learn in the beginning if you just want to understand the basic concept

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.760
like for a start.

00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.800
Yeah, absolutely.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.840
Another thing you put out there was CodeClub.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:48.240
Yeah, that's, I think a really cool resource by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:55.040
So it's a platform and it guides your kids from lesson to lesson.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:59.520
So you start with learning Scratch, but then it progresses onto Python.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:05.200
And yeah, you can start, I think at the age of eight, yeah, you can start at the age of

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.960
eight, which is also the recommended age for Scratch.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:14.960
And this is just an example for a full platform that you can use to guide yourself or your

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:18.240
children through progressing from one thing to the other.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.240
And I think it's also free.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:26.000
So if you start looking, there are lots of online coding classes that you can use that

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.840
teach you different things and have a whole program and sets of ideas behind how to approach

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.640
different topics.

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.680
Yeah, this looks very fun.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.200
And the example, at least they have on the screen is using Blockly, right?

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.400
Or Scratch, one of them.

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.360
I think it's Scratch.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.000
Yeah, I think level one is Scratch and then level two would be Python and more comes after

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:44.320
that.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.680
Yeah, that's really cool.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.480
Another one in this realm is Hetty.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.840
I had not heard of Hetty.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.960
Yeah, me neither.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:56.880
Just when I started researching the topic, why I chose it as an example is that I just

00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:59.440
like the concept of gradual programming.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:05.120
So gradual programming means that what I just mentioned, basically, that if you learn language

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:10.000
speaking or like a programming language, you have to learn a lot at the same time.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.120
It can be overwhelming.

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:17.680
You have concepts like loops, if else, and syntax like quotation marks, round brackets.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.920
And in Hetty, it's free.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:26.080
Like it's a web-based interface and you concepts are introduced with as little syntax and then

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.040
refined.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:31.680
So in the beginning, you can just type print and the text and you don't have to worry about

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:33.360
quotation marks or brackets.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.200
It's just introduced at a later stage.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:38.080
So it mimics the way in which we would learn a language.

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.480
And in the end, you like it's based on Python.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:45.760
So you learn a subset of Python, not the entire programming language, but it's syntactically

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:48.080
valid and you have all the right syntax.

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:53.760
But for some kids, it might be easier to get started with having not everything like being

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.920
part of what you have to code yourself.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:56.160
Right.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.960
Like learning, oh, whoops, you forgot to close the parentheses.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:01.440
So it's not going to run or you forgot to close the quote.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:02.160
So it won't work.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:02.800
Something like that.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.520
Yeah, exactly.

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:03.680
Yeah.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.520
Kids run into that all the time because they're like, well, I see the words on the screen

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.320
that I wanted to do, but no, no, you got to put it in quotes.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.040
Why?

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.800
Oh, and maybe regarding the age, this is recommended for age 10 plus years.

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:20.000
So yeah, when you want to get started with actual textual programming, so it fits into

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.640
the third age range that we discussed.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:27.760
That's pretty much the last limited age range, I guess you would say, before you just go

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.280
and do regular programming, right?

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:29.680
Exactly.

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:33.600
From there, you can just progress on to more traditional programming languages.

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:38.000
There are lots of resources like from the Bersperry Pi Foundation.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.200
They have Python courses and there are some on Udemy.

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.720
If you start looking, there are tons of resources to get started.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:51.520
There are lots of online and on-site classes that teach kids starting at various ages.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:56.960
Yeah, I know about a few German offers where you can really find what you're interested

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:03.600
in, which is really important, like make coding fun and learning fun for kids.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:08.080
So find out what they are interested in, what their passion is, and then find something

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.840
that fits their interest.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:14.800
I'm sure there's a ton of stuff on YouTube as well to help people, but at least I'm out

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:15.200
of touch.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:17.120
I bet there's a lot on TikTok, actually.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.280
Oh yeah, I'm out of touch with that as well.

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:24.480
Just, you know, you learn one concept every 30 seconds, you just swipe away until you're

00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.120
a programmer.

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:29.600
I should actually look at that probably when talking about coding with kids.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:32.720
I guess that's something that can play a big part.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.200
For sure, Instagram Reels or whatever.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:39.840
All right, I think that kind of touches on most of the resources that we have.

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:45.200
There's one more I do want to talk about, though, and I think this is probably as good

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:52.560
around, it's beyond the code combat stage where kids can actually use an editor to create

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.840
proper, valid syntax, but it's not much beyond that.

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:58.160
And that's Anvil, at anvil.works.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.200
Are you familiar with Anvil?

00:43:59.200 --> 00:43:59.440
No.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:05.280
So I've had, Meredith, the creator of this online and on the show, but what's really

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:12.480
interesting is it's a way to visually build web pages that are actual real web pages that

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.880
people can actually, you know, you publish it, your family or your friends could use

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.200
it.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.840
So if you wanted to build, you know, something like a Harry Potter type thing and you could

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:26.080
have your friends vote on which one, which character is their favorite or and why or

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.520
whatever, you know, like you could build this into a web page and publish it.

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:33.520
And with so many of these projects, it's like, okay, I built this cool thing.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:34.560
How do I share it?

00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:37.280
Or how do I make it look like the thing that I use?

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.000
And so you can do this drag and drop, build it out thing.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.480
But then you write the front end, the front end interactive code in Python and true Python,

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:47.280
JavaScript.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.000
And then it has kind of like a simplified database in the back end.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.240
So it has like a little bit of like persistence and storage, but it's, it's really cool.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:59.120
After we did code combat with my daughter, we went and we did this and she built a bunch

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:02.400
of things that were like, really, she really thought were pretty neat.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:06.960
She could share with people and have people input little text messages or whatever.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:07.760
- I love that.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.080
Yeah.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.360
I would learn again.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:13.920
I know very, I have very little knowledge about web programming.

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.560
This would be a good tool for me to get started as well.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:16.880
- Yeah.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:22.240
Well, also the problem is even if you're a very good web programmer, it's like, okay,

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:29.280
kid, you go from code combat to now you're doing CSS, HTML, database, you know, like

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:32.800
the, the explosion of complexity to puts, and then you do all that.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.240
And then how do you even put it on the web?

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:38.000
It's just so out of control that step from one to the next.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.080
And so if people want to do anything with like web pages and Python, this is a really

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:42.880
cool option.

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:43.600
I think right here.

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.240
- Pretty cool.

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:44.800
Yeah.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:50.480
And like speaking from your experience, how did you get your kids excited about coding?

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.120
Did they just like it or do they hate it?

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:58.080
- My older daughters, they grew up with less technology because they're older.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:03.200
So at first they weren't super into it, but then they got into college and they had to

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.840
start learning things for their degree.

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:10.640
And so now one of my daughters is doing a lot with R, which is fine because she's in

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.800
psychology and that's what all of her colleagues are using.

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.960
- Which is fine.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.640
It's not ideal, but it's fine.

00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:17.280
- It's not ideal.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.000
It's fine.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.440
No, I'm not that district.

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.400
No, I'm very proud of her.

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.200
I think there's different things that can motivate you.

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.320
You know, you can just be curious.

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:26.560
Like my youngest daughter's like, let's play games.

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.160
Let's play code combat.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.080
Then she's like, I want to build something for my friend.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:30.320
You know?

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:35.200
And then so we did this thing with Anvil and she was very motivated, like seek out the

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.240
technology and play with it.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.320
Whereas my older daughters, I think they weren't that interested and they had other things

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:45.520
to do, but once they got somewhere with a job or with their education where they needed

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.360
it, then all of a sudden it was more interesting.

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:49.600
So, you know, it varies by kid, I think.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.880
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.160
And I guess that's fine as well.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:56.800
Not everyone needs to like coding, but just having the opportunity to learn about it and

00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:01.760
experience yourself, if it's something that you're actually like, I was just so blown

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.680
away when I experienced how fun it is to learn how to code.

00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:11.280
I always thought it was boring and yeah, having all these stereotypes in my head because I

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.360
never actually knew anyone that was coding.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:15.760
- Yeah.

00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.800
- It's nice that they had the opportunity to learn about it at home.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:20.000
- Yeah, it absolutely is.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.720
So I think we have a little more follow-up here on the TikTok learning style.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:29.440
@5fast_tether says, "You can learn every single short, but you won't remember anything as

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.160
you flip through them."

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:30.800
(laughing)

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.640
Flip, flip, flip, which is probably true.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:37.440
And then also @Krishan asks, "Do you think Scratch is good to start with for kids?"

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.920
Like if you had a kid who was 10, 11, 12, 13, what would you start them with?

00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.240
- Yeah, I would get started with visual programming.

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.680
I think it makes it easier.

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:49.920
I know that for some kids, it can be hard then to progress onto textual programming,

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.920
but I guess this is just a general thing.

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.240
You need to see what works.

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:58.960
It's not that you, it might be that you start with one thing and you see, actually, it doesn't

00:47:58.960 --> 00:47:59.600
work for us.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.560
And then you have to switch tracks and that will happen a lot.

00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:03.760
And that's just fine.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.920
You need to find your own path through it.

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:11.200
And don't be afraid to actually make changes if you are not enjoying what, or your kid

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.560
is not enjoying their work.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:18.480
I think visual programming is a great and fun way to get started with coding concepts

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:21.680
and not have it feel like you're actually coding.

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:22.560
- Absolutely.

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.040
So @Krishan's child is 13.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.480
I would consider code combat, actually.

00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:32.560
I think, you know, 13, you're well enough to do textual stuff if it's not too much drudgery,

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:32.880
right?

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.280
Like matching braces and quotes and all that.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.720
So maybe if this kind of thing inspires, maybe that as well.

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:39.600
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:44.000
I think 13 is great for getting started with textual programming as well.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.920
And what is so nice about having large language models now is that lots of these offers are

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:56.160
being translated to various languages and it is becoming much more easy to get started

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:58.720
in your native language, which might not be English.

00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:02.960
And then you do not have to learn a language while you learn how to code.

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:06.480
Yeah, that's also, I think, a huge advantage of the current time.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:12.080
- That's something that's always been interesting to me is so many of the programming languages

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:17.120
are in English, but many of the programmers, their first language is not English.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:17.360
- Yeah.

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:20.720
- And you know, maybe like your English is perfect, I'm sure, you know,

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:22.640
for a while is no big deal.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.760
But when you're 10 years old, here, you need to learn a program.

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.520
Well, by the way, it's in a foreign language.

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:28.720
That's pretty wild, right?

00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.160
That's gotta be challenging.

00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:31.840
What was your, like, how do you feel about this?

00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:33.280
I mean, you're more in it than I am.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:37.200
- Yeah, I would always start, like, if you have the chance, then start in the native

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:42.240
language of the child and you will definitely find good ways to get started and good offers.

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:47.360
For example, Scratch, I think, is available in lots of languages, 70 languages, actually.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:53.840
Choose something that keeps the cognitive effort that you need to get started with simpler,

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:57.440
because otherwise you really have to learn two things at the same time,

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.600
learning a language and learning all these concepts.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:02.240
And it can then be overwhelming.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.520
- It's not something that I had to deal with, but looking back, I'm like, wow,

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:10.080
I was pretty lucky that I didn't have to learn what all the keywords meant in addition to

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:11.280
just what I was trying to do.

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:16.960
- That's also actually why I decided to study in English, because I knew all the papers I'm

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.760
reading are in English, all the code I'm writing is in English.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:22.000
It doesn't make sense to study it in German.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.120
It's just weird.

00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:27.680
- The internet has done some interesting things to just sort of spread everything around globally.

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:30.080
So, all right, Elena, this has been awesome.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:34.080
A bunch of concrete things for people to take and work with their kids,

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:37.440
maybe if they're grandparents, their grandchildren, or if they're teachers,

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.360
or friends, kids, or whatever, right?

00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:40.000
- Whatever, yeah.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:40.640
- Yeah.

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.600
How about some final advice to close out the topic?

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:48.160
- Yeah, I think for me, two things are the most important ones, namely, first,

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:53.920
don't force your child to learn how to code, but see if you can find a way that makes it fun for

00:50:53.920 --> 00:51:02.240
them. I think making or learning that learning is actually a cool thing, is like it offers you,

00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:08.000
or it opens you so many doors in your life that you learn that putting in the effort,

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.600
and even if something is complicated, it's worth it.

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:16.640
It's just one of the most valuable skills you can provide your child with.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.240
So, yeah, learning how to learn and how to love learning, I guess.

00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:26.400
And there's lots of ways in which you can do it. Choose the right topics, be patient,

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:31.520
sit down with your kids and learn together. Don't force them to sit down for long times,

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:37.600
and like rather distribute learning sessions over time. Don't be afraid to switch tracks.

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:42.320
Lots of the things that apply to adults also apply to children regarding learning.

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:48.800
- Very good advice. I would just maybe re-emphasize that people should reward persistence.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:52.960
Reward it very, very highly. Like, I can't believe you spent half an hour and you just

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:56.720
got barely got it to print hello, but that's actually a massive accomplishment. And like,

00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:00.320
I'm so proud of how hard you focused and worked on it, right? That's a big deal.

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.920
- Yeah. That's like, it makes a huge difference to two kids.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.960
- Probably adults as well.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:09.680
- Yeah, yeah. Everyone. But you lay the foundation for learning, right? So if you...

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:14.880
- Yeah. I mean, that expands on to being good at literature or being good at philosophy or like,

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.640
whatever it is that's hard to learn.

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:19.360
- And just believing that you can learn anything.

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:23.440
- Yes, exactly. And the other is to try to capture inspiration. If they're like,

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:26.960
really, really excited and they really want to learn a thing at that moment,

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:29.360
then you could introduce some of these tools. But if they're like,

00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:31.440
I want to go outside and play with my friends. You're like, no, come in here,

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.080
we're doing coding. Like maybe that's not the moment, yeah?

00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:34.960
- Exactly. Yeah.

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.560
- All right. Thank you for taking the time to put this all together and coming on the show

00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:39.760
and nice to have you back. So.

00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:40.160
- Thank you.

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.360
- Yeah. Thanks. Bye.

00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:41.760
- Bye.
