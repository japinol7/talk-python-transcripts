00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
We all know that privacy regulations are getting more strict and that many of our users no longer


00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.800
believe that privacy is dead. But for even medium-sized organizations, actually tracking


00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.440
how we are using personal information in our myriad of applications and services


00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.040
is very tricky and error-prone. On this episode, we have Thomas LaPiana from the FIDES project


00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.000
here to discuss privacy in our applications and how the FIDES project can enforce and track


00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.720
privacy requirements in your Python applications. This is Talk Python to Me, episode 409, recorded

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.320
having me. Yeah, it's great to have you here. I'm excited to talk about privacy. I feel


00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.120
like there was this period where everyone just gave up and decided privacy


00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.620
doesn't matter either because it was a good trade off for them at the time, or


00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.000
they decided it was, you know, trying to push a rock up a hill that was never


00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
going to make it to the top.


00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.800
And so you just don't, don't stress about it, but I feel, you know, like


00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.800
things are coming back a little bit and, you know, we all get to be


00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.880
semi-autonomous beings again.


00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.560
Yeah.


00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.040
There's definitely been that feeling that, and I think actually it, it a


00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.680
little bit mirrors the way things are going with AI now, right.


00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.080
where people feel like the genie's out of the bottle, how do we put it back?


00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.600
But I think we've actually seen that happen successfully with privacy,


00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.560
where there was a long time when, you know, you talk to your parents about,


00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.320
hey, maybe don't use Facebook.


00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.400
I know this happens to me at least, right? Personal anecdotes.


00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.640
So, hey, maybe don't use Facebook.


00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.960
You sell your data.


00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.920
And the response is always like, well, who cares?


00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.080
So I'm not I'm not doing anything bad anyway.


00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.280
Why does it matter?


00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.400
And I think we've seen very much a reversion to, hey, actually,


00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.920
maybe I don't want my insurance company to know everything about me


00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.080
and my family's medical history type of thing.


00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.720
And people are starting to care about it again.


00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.040
And somehow we're getting that genie back in the bottle, which is, which is great.


00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.200
The internet used to be, it's this thing on the side.


00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.040
It was like a hobby or something you were interested in.


00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.160
Like, Oh, I'll go on the internet and I'll read, read some user forums or I'll search


00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.880
for some interesting thing that I might be interested in.


00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.920
And now it's become all encompassing, right?


00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.320
Tech, tech and everything else is interwoven so much that I think people are


00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.160
are starting to realize like, oh, if all of these companies can buy, sell, and


00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.520
exchange too much information about me, then that might actually have a real


00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.440
effect in my regular life, my day-to-day life, right?


00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.640
It's not just like, oh, I get weird ads on my hobby time off that I fiddle with


00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.480
the screen, like, no, this is, this is everything, right?


00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.160
And so we're going to talk a little bit about the laws and the rules that are


00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.520
coming into place, a little bit of these, these changes, but mostly some platforms


00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.880
that you all are creating to allow companies,


00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.040
especially large companies with complex data intermingling,


00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.800
to abide by these laws and be good citizens


00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.240
of this new world that we're talking about?


00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.080
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.480
And I think that's another thing we've seen


00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.040
as part of this shift of consumers caring about privacy


00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.080
is you also have individual engineers


00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.600
or individual contributors or managers


00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.880
or people within the organizations


00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.360
that regardless of what laws may require them to do,


00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.200
they also do care about building privacy-respecting software


00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.440
just as the right thing to do.


00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.280
And I think we've, yeah,


00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.740
we've seen a kind of a general trend in that as well.


00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.200
So that's been good to see.


00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.040
- Yeah.


00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.000
Well, I'm looking forward to exploring the ideas


00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.840
and then the platform as well.


00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.000
Before we get to that though,


00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.040
let's start with your story.


00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.280
How'd you get into programming, Python, privacy,


00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.720
all these things?


00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.480
- So I actually studied politics in college,


00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.880
but my best friend was a computer science major.


00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.720
And when I found out that in college,


00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.680
he was already freelancing, working at home


00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.180
and making way more money than I did in my part-time job.


00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.180
I was like, hold on, I think this computer science thing


00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.780
might have a future.


00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.260
So I was just kind of self-taught,


00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.380
and I ended up doing some data.


00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.300
I got a data intelligence job right out of school


00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.100
despite having zero relevant experience or knowledge.


00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.060
And I was told like a week or two in to,


00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.560
I was working on this case that we had,


00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.860
and I had to pull stuff from API and put it in database.


00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.300
And I had basically never really written


00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.580
a line of code before.


00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.240
And I somehow ended up on Python


00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.280
and somehow ended up with, you know, my SQL


00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.520
and I made it work.


00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.860
And just from there, just fell in love with the,


00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.720
really the problem solving aspect of coding


00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:18.220
and just creating value from basically nothing, right?


00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.940
- Yeah, I can just see how that search goes.


00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.880
You know, how do I easily pull data from API?


00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.140
Use requests in Python.


00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.120
I go, okay, let's give this a try.


00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.240
- It was probably something similar.


00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.800
I think I had a friend, you know,


00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.000
in the Slack team at the time that was in,


00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.140
you know, into Python or something.


00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.540
And I think I just ended up on Python


00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.220
and it's been one of the best accidents of my life.


00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.500
Now, however many years later,


00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.900
still working with Python daily.


00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.100
- Yeah, excellent.


00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.580
And now what are you doing for a job?


00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.500
- Yeah, so I'm working at a company called Ethica.


00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.500
So we focus on privacy tooling for engineers specifically


00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.540
or in a broader sense these days,


00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.940
working on privacy tools in general


00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.180
that can be kind of a meeting point


00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.620
between engineers and compliance professionals, right?


00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.260
So like the compliance team lawyers,


00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.140
things of that nature, your company,


00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.020
trying to build a common ground for them


00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.380
to kind of build off of and work together in.


00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:12.540
- Excellent, it sounds really fun.


00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.380
And you've got a cool platform


00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.160
that you all have open sourced,


00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.300
and we're gonna talk about that in a minute.


00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.500
But let's keep it high level for a moment.


00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.540
I talked about the swinging pendulum


00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.820
where it went to like, "YOLO, I don't care.


00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.800
"Internet's fun, it's free, it doesn't matter to you.


00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.300
"Oh my gosh, it matters, I want my privacy back.


00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.120
"I can't believe people are doing X, Y, and Z


00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.560
and not just showing me ads with this.


00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.080
So we got the GDPR, obviously that made such a huge splash that made me


00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.840
personally scramble to match, to meet the requirements.


00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.320
And what I think is really interesting about that is those kinds of laws, and


00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.120
maybe I could get your thoughts on this.


00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.600
I think it's, it's a bit of a problem or a challenge and these kinds of laws,


00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.560
you can just see through the veil.


00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.160
Like, okay, it talks about internet company or something, but what they


00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:09.360
mean those Facebook, Google, you know, like there are five huge companies or


00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.360
something in the world.


00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.820
Most of them on the West coast of the U S that are like bullseye.


00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.980
The, the, the, the sites are on them and these laws trying to apply to them.


00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:18.660
Yes.


00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.200
In general, outside of it too, but like it's, it's those five or whatever that


00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.940
really, you know, were the catalyst for this.


00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.420
Whereas, you know, small companies like me are like, oh, well I have to have a


00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.860
recorded history of an opt-in, not just an opt-in in principle, but I need


00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.580
the date and a time and I need a record.


00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.900
So I got to go rewrite my systems so that I can have a record of opt-in


00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.500
for communications if I have it.


00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.740
And when there's one or two of you at a company that shuts the company down for


00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.700
weeks, when there's 10 people at Google that I got to stop and go do that,


00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.660
Google just keeps going.


00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.120
Right.


00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.120
And so there's this tension of, I think,


00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.480
unintended harm that can come from these


00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.040
by asking for a blanket equal compliance


00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.040
when they're really what the laws are written for


00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.440
and people have in mind are like these mega


00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.920
trillion dollar companies that have unlimited money


00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.800
to solve these problems.


00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.440
How do you see that in the world?


00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.760
- Yeah, it's been, so I think specifically with the CCPA,


00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.040
which is the California Consumer Privacy Act,


00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.680
they kind of noticed that and there is actually a cutoff,


00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.640
I believe, I wanna say something like revenue revaluation


00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.480
under 50 million.


00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.360
So there is kind of a safety clause for smaller businesses


00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.400
because like you said, when GDPR came in


00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.640
and it just went after everyone, right?


00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.600
Irrespective of size or resources.


00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.120
And it was actually more of a punishment


00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.720
for smaller companies.


00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.560
Because like you said, if they come for you, Michael,


00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.040
and they say, "Hey, talk Python, you're doing great.


00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.040
"You've got all this data.


00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.560
"All these people are buying courses,


00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.440
but you're not keeping track of consent or whatever.


00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.040
And like you're, you know, you're one or two person team, you know,


00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.160
now you've got to stop for weeks and Google and Facebook,


00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.940
they have the privilege and the ability to, yeah,


00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.360
they're going to hire privacy engineers and they're going to try to do things


00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.600
the right way. But if they could find a few hundred million,


00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.480
it's just the cost of doing business, right? They, they,


00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.560
they are calculating these fines as part of their annual spend.


00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.520
And that's just, that's just how they do it. Whereas for you, that could be,


00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.080
you know,


00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.240
something that ends your business or puts you in hot water or does something


00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.800
else. Or maybe just you don't even want to do business in the EU anymore, because it's


00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.240
too much of a hassle compared to what it was before. So I think yes, GDPR really misstepped


00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.760
there and it did end up punishing a lot of smaller businesses. But I think they've learned


00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.160
from that, they're trying to iterate on it. I think cookie consent is a big one. They're


00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.000
now kind of revisiting that and saying, hold on, did we implement this the right way? Did


00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.840
everyone implement this the right way? And I think the CCPA is building on that in a


00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.200
really good way. And we can see there's also a lot of shared language. So I think even


00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.120
Even though GDPR was, it was disruptive, and it probably hurt the people that it didn't


00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:59.240
mean to hurt, at least initially, but it was still a pretty good base for us to work off


00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:03.280
of just in terms of a general privacy framework and will hopefully get us to a place that's


00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.040
a little bit more equitable in terms of who's being punished and who's actually dangerous.


00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:12.040
Like you said, it was like a few outliers that brought about this requirement, right?


00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.880
It was Facebook acquiring WhatsApp and then doing uncool things with access to both natives.


00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.360
So it was things like that, that this was designed to stop.


00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.000
I think slowly we're getting to a place


00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.680
where it's being wielded more in that vein.


00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.240
- Yeah, the US Supreme Court has not ruled yet


00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.520
on section 230, but who knows what that's gonna unleash.


00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.360
That's a whole nother topic, we're not on that one.


00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.680
But you know, I mean, there's still large waves


00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:37.960
like that could crest and crash and whatnot.


00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.840
I do wanna come out and say explicitly,


00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.080
I'm not against the GDPR, and I'm not unhappy


00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.960
that I changed my systems around to comply to it.


00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.960
Like it's really important to me.


00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.200
I've talked to advertisers and told them,


00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.940
no, we're not inserting tracking pixels.


00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.720
We're not inserting other types of retargeting stuff for you.


00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.880
If you need that more than you need to talk to my audience,


00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.120
you go find some other audience.


00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.200
Like seriously, I've told them to go away.


00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.960
And usually they're like, okay, fine.


00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:07.960
We'll work around it.


00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.040
But I also just want to kind of put that out there


00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.500
like a look, these rules come in aimed at the top and sweep up a bunch of other


00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.340
people as well.


00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:17.580
Right.


00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.780
So I think there's like this mixed bag, I guess is what I'm trying to say.


00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.100
Yeah, there definitely is.


00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:25.620
And funny you mentioned that, like there are, I was, I was shocked for you to see


00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.620
to find out that their podcast I'm subscribed to, not yours, so don't worry.


00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.060
A podcast I've subscribed to that I can't even download on a VPN because there's,


00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.780
it is just like, there's some tracking requirement that my VPN blocks that it


00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.020
won't even let me download the episode, which is, it's just crazy to think that


00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:41.440
that that's kind of the point where we're at,


00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.660
even with podcasts.


00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.580
- It's really terrible.


00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.900
And a lot of that, I think,


00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.060
comes from people wanting to do dynamic ad insertion.


00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:48.900
- Yeah.


00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.020
- Right, they wanna go, okay,


00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:54.620
this person is coming from this IP address in this town,


00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.140
and we have this extra information we've gathered


00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.260
from like these nefarious back channels.


00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.220
And we're pretty sure, pretty sure that's Thomas,


00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.600
and he works in tech, and we're gonna offer,


00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.900
we're gonna dynamically insert this, you know,


00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:12.940
And if, if they, if there's walls that stop that, then, then maybe, maybe


00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:16.060
now, let me go on one more really, really quick rant here.


00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.420
Uh, just to mention the cook though, this, this cookie can say, no, I'll


00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:24.140
try to not be on the soapbox too much for this episode, but I think right


00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.540
here at the CCPA, the California law, this right to non-discrimination


00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.900
for exercising your rights.


00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:34.500
When I look at the web these days, I, those, all these cookie pop up


00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.340
notifications, they're like the plague.


00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:37.580
They're just everywhere.


00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.840
Many of them just say, you have to just say, okay, or go away.


00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.700
And you know, it's like, okay, well that's not a lot of control I have.


00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.420
Um, on the other hand, we have a lot of technology control.


00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.640
I have a, my network, I have next DNS, which will block almost all the tracking


00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.600
and retargeting and all of that stuff.


00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.600
Um, I use Vivaldi with the ad blocker on and I'll go to these places and


00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.060
they'll say, turn off your ad blocker.


00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:04.200
And if they'll show you the cookie thing and they'll say, turn off your ad blocker.


00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.200
If you don't turn it off, you don't get to come in.


00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.020
I think what they should have done instead of having a law that says you have to


00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:14.400
tell people you're tracking them and then make them press okay.


00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.700
And then track the heck out of them.


00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:16.040
Right.


00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:21.060
Say like kind of this last line here in the CCPA say there's a right to


00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.380
non-discrimination for exercising your privacy and say, you should be able to


00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:30.780
have an ad blocker or other tracking protection mechanisms without being


00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.520
punished or blocked compared to the other visitors that would have solved it.


00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.600
And there'd be no need for these pop-ups everywhere.


00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.600
We could just, if as a informed citizenship,


00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.840
if we decide we want to run ad blockers


00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.680
or other types of tracking blockers,


00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.840
we can and we just go about our business, right?


00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.680
Like that would have been a more sophisticated solution,


00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.480
I think, than making everybody say,


00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.600
okay, I agree, you're tracking me, let's go.


00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.680
- Yeah, this is, yeah, obviously,


00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.880
I think it's been contentious, right?


00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.320
Like I can barely remember the internet now


00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.480
despite it being just a few years ago when,


00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.320
and now it's just so normal.


00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.360
You go to a website and you're just waiting. You're waiting for the other shoe to drop


00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.800
and the thing pops up and you click the thing.


00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.720
Where's the cookie thing? Okay, I got it. I got it. It's out.


00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.200
Exactly.


00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.880
Is it in the top or the bottom of this one?


00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.960
Yeah. It's a mini game every time you go to a new website. And there are even browsers now


00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.760
that have a toggle of just reject. Just don't show me cookie consents. Just do it for me type


00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.000
of thing.


00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.640
Yes. I accept them. I accept them.


00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:30.240
Yeah. And I understand why it was there. They want people to be aware of what's going on,


00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.000
But it's kind of like, you know, EULAs or end user license agreements or whatever.


00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.760
Like people don't really stop to read if you're informed, right?


00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:41.640
And again, this is where actually I think the talking about non-discrimination and kind


00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.280
of the privilege of being more privacy where there are a lot of people, right?


00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.960
If you look at, you know, someone like my parents who, you know,


00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:50.520
they're going to go to the websites, they're going to see the thing that's like, hey,


00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.000
we're using -- they don't know what a consent cookie is.


00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.800
They have no idea what the concept of tracking on a website is.


00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:58.120
They don't know what the data is actually used for, anything like that.


00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.960
So once again, it's just kind of an inconvenience


00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.120
that I don't think really increases anyone's privacy,


00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.520
especially because a lot of companies


00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.340
are still using the dark pattern of,


00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.600
you can click yes, track everything,


00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.800
but if you wanna reject


00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.480
or you wanna only give the required cookies,


00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.520
it's like another step or two, and it's unobvious,


00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.360
and it's like, you know, just a tiny little hyperlink text


00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.200
you have to click on.


00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.040
It's not a big, flashy button.


00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.720
- Light gray on dark gray.


00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.200
(laughing)


00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.240
- Exactly, exactly. - Text or something, yeah.


00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:27.560
- Exactly, something like that.


00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.600
Hey folks, let's pause for an ad.


00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.400
Remember last time I had an ad for Microsoft for Startups?


00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.760
This time around, I asked the AI to have some fun with it


00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.320
just to show you how powerful


00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.240
what they have on offer really is.


00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.120
Here we go.


00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.080
Me.


00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.680
Can you rewrite the Founders Hub ad


00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:45.680
in the style of a corporate executive


00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.480
using too many buzzwords?


00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.400
AI.


00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.240
Sure.


00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.720
Here's a rephrased version of the ad in corporate speak.

We're not totally figuring it out.


00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.520
There's, there's attempts sometimes that don't really have the outcome.


00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.720
I think people intended like this cookie consent one.


00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.080
Um, but, but there's still the, the idea behind it was, was pretty good, even if


00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:40.880
the way it came out, wasn't that great.


00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:42.540
At least my perception.


00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.760
I know some people really appreciate the ability to have those buttons, but I just


00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.880
say like, I'm just going to block it no matter what I answer is not coming through.


00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.680
So I don't care.


00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.440
Um, but companies have to live in this world, right?


00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.120
They have to live in the world where the pendulum is swinging back.


00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:01.560
And so I guess, you know, we talked about GDPR and I really want to go too much


00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.080
more into it at this point, because we talked about so much, there's an


00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:09.000
interesting article called the 30 biggest GDPR finds so far, and it's not


00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.120
updated for this year, but people can look through and see what kind of, you


00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.960
know, it's the, it's exactly the companies that I ascribed for the most part, except


00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.860
for there's like some weird ones in here.


00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:24.100
I don't know if you've seen this article, but there's like H&M, this German clothing


00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.940
company where they like film their employees and then like shared that internally.


00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:31.980
And that was the violation, which was unusual.


00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.340
But so these are the ones that people might know.


00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.340
Go ahead.


00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.340
What are you gonna say about that?


00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.940
I was gonna say that a lot of people actually forget.


00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:42.980
I think that's an interesting one specifically because GDPR has kind of different classes


00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:43.980
of people it protects.


00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.220
And actually, employees is absolutely one of them.


00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:50.700
Because a thing that you will see is companies will use internal employee data


00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.820
and say, "Well, there are employees.


00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.060
They don't have data privacy rights because they work for us.


00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.740
So we can use their information however they want to be."


00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:56.940
You can't do that, right?


00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.900
GDPR says specifically, "Yeah, you can't sell your employees data.


00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:05.020
You can't use their biometrics for whatever you want to," all that kind of stuff.


00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:08.940
So I think it is really important also that H&M got fined for that because it's showing,


00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.900
"Hey, you have to treat your employees as well as you treat your customers."


00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:12.900
when it comes to data privacy.


00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:13.740
- Interesting. - It's pretty cool.


00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.700
- Yeah, it's not just your web visitors,


00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.540
it's the people that--


00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.300
- Exactly, it's trying to protect everyone,


00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:21.340
no matter what their relation is to said company.


00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.780
- Another one I think that just highlights


00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.180
the greater subtlety of all of this


00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.580
is this article in the register entitled,


00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:31.420
"Website fined by German court for leaking visitors'


00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:34.340
"IP address via Google Fonts."


00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:35.900
Are you familiar with this at all?


00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.060
- Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar with it.


00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.980
I think it's an interesting case


00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:45.340
you can see the fine is 100 pounds, right? Or sorry, not pounds, 100 euros, which ends up being


00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:50.620
110 US dollars. And so I think it was very much meant to catch news headlines, right? And just


00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.820
kind of warn people, "Hey, we've now kind of decided that Google Fonts is not going to be


00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.980
great. And so this is a very inexpensive warning to everyone else that maybe you should start


00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:06.620
looking into if you're using Google Fonts or not." Yeah, I find this very interesting. Because again,


00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.180
it's almost like the cookie can set thing.


00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:11.260
This will ripple across most websites probably.


00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:14.540
- Right, I think people think about Google Analytics


00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:19.180
and some of these other conversion tracking systems


00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.020
that you plug in, you're like,


00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:21.180
"Okay, I realize we're tracking."


00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:23.100
But even really subtle little things


00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:27.620
like linking to an image of a YouTube video,


00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:31.300
like that will drop cookies from YouTube and Google


00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:33.740
onto your visitors and all those things.


00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:35.980
You're like, "Wait a minute, I just pointed an image?


00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.540
like that's nuts. And this is like this, when I read this, I thought, oh, maybe there's like one


00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:45.260
person that sued this company and they got $100 or something, I don't know. But what if they had


00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:49.980
100 million visitors and everyone decided, oh, we'll do a class action lawsuit. I mean, it could


00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.460
explode. I think that's why it caught the headlines so much.


00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:57.260
Yeah. And so most of the time it is like with these violations, and this is where it even gets


00:20:57.260 --> 00:21:03.420
a little bit sticky because individual countries, data protection kind of agencies will go after


00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.420
companies. So if you are... For instance, a lot of big ones happen in Ireland because, again,


00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:11.580
a lot of tech companies, especially Silicon Valley tech companies have headquarters in Ireland.


00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:16.460
So you see the Irish privacy authority levy a lot of these fines in some cases,


00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.420
although people are criticizing them for being kind of lenient. But I think in this case,


00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:24.700
it was very specifically, like you said, for one reason or another, someone or the government just


00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:29.500
decided, "Hey, we need to call out this Google hosted web font and warn everyone else that,


00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.940
"Hey, maybe you shouldn't be using those."


00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.780
I don't know, it is very interesting.


00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:34.740
And I do feel like a lot of these go under the radar.


00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.180
- I think they do, and I don't even think


00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.260
they name the company that this was applied to.


00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.380
By the way, people, if they're like, "But what do we do?"


00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:46.260
Fonts.bunny.net is a really cool option.


00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.580
Zero tracking, no logging, privacy first,


00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:51.820
you are compliant, and a drop-in replacement


00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:52.780
for Google Fonts.


00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.220
So people should check that out.


00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.940
If they're like, "I kind of want this functionality,


00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.780
"but I kind of don't want it anymore."


00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:00.860
(both laughing)


00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.880
- Yeah, so that's a pretty cool option.


00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.280
All right, so that sets the stage a little bit,


00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.700
but let's maybe talk about some of the problems


00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.760
that large organizations have.


00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.160
So I know that you worked at a large organization


00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.640
where it was like, we have this,


00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.840
what data do you have about me request,


00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.580
or how do you use my data request?


00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.580
And I can only imagine at a multiple thousand person company


00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.800
there's these databases and people like dip into them


00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.920
and take something and then who knows where it goes.


00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.620
And then they hook up some third party other thing


00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.460
and then like, it's off to the races.


00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.840
Like, tell me what you did with that.


00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.980
Like, I don't know, it's out.


00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:42.520
- Yeah, it feels like the,


00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.680
maybe this is too much of an American cultural reference,


00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.280
but like a take a penny, leave a penny, but for data, right?


00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:48.820
Like, you might drop some in there,


00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.060
you might take some out.


00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:51.280
No one really knows where it went.


00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.780
It's just now circulating in the broader economy.


00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:57.860
And so with that company, this is my last company,


00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.380
also a startup, and I was a data engineer there.


00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.180
So I've been mostly a data engineer


00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.460
until my current position.


00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:04.460
And it got to the point where,


00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.420
and this is gonna sound crazy,


00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.020
we were, luckily through the power of like,


00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.740
you know, Snowflake and DBT and things like that,


00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.060
we were able to actually replicate


00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.700
a data warehouse per country.


00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.500
So like all of our EU data stayed in EU,


00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.100
all of our Canada data stayed in Canada.


00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.460
We were basically just spitting up


00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:21.900
as many warehouses we needed to.


00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.500
Like so when CCPA came online, we were like,


00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.300
All right, we're spinning one up in California


00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.020
and then the rest of the US has one somewhere else, right?


00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.620
But it's just obviously, that's just not sustainable.


00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.180
We were relatively small data engineering team


00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.140
and we automated most of it,


00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.300
but it was very clear that that became a huge problem.


00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.820
- It might be sustainable if it's Europe, US and other,


00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.660
or something like that.


00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:41.500
- Right, exactly.


00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.340
- Where the US people-


00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.860
- Australia was slowly gonna get on that list, yeah.


00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.700
- We're like, all right, US people,


00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:49.380
they get no protections.


00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:50.260
We sell them like crazy.


00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.980
The Europeans will be a couple of them


00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.860
- The Canadians, they're nice, we'll kind of be nice with them.


00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:01.100
But we're seeing this stuff pop up more and more, like more regionally, and it's getting


00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:02.100
harder and harder to follow.


00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.880
- Yeah, that was the problem, right?


00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.620
When it's California and then the rest of the US, which at the time it was, this was


00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:11.460
a few years ago, and say, "Okay, so we have a data center in California to comply with


00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.300
CCPA and then we have a data center outside of California and we're good."


00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.780
And I was like, "Well, like Virginia just passed a security law.


00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.060
I don't think we have servers in Virginia."


00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.980
like, oh, like Idaho just passed.


00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.060
I don't know if there's server farms in Idaho.


00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.740
It's like, you know, it became a problem like that


00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:27.140
where you can't, you're not gonna spin up 50,


00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.860
you know, data centers, one in each.


00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:30.780
Like, I don't know why you probably didn't have data centers.


00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:31.980
Energy's tough there, so.


00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.100
- But they did, if you need to spin them up,


00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:36.380
you need to do it in person and it's gonna take a month.


00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.460
- Yeah, exactly, exactly.


00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:39.300
It's very true.


00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.140
- Sorry, I got a bad tan, but the data center's coming along.


00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:46.380
- Yeah, so it was, you know, so that complexity, right?


00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:47.740
So all these different laws.


00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:51.400
But then on top of that, like you said, putting in the access controls for


00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:56.480
figuring out where data is going and how, so definitely having a tool like dbt,


00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.180
which if people don't know, it's kind of like a very programming focused data


00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:01.700
analytics tool, building models and stuff.


00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.180
So you had a good lineage draft of where all the data was coming from, what it


00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.780
was doing, but we still had to document our use because legally you have to have


00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:13.560
a valid use for every piece of data that you are storing in there and things like


00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.040
And so I was just spending more and more time in calls with, you know, our, our,


00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.480
our security team and our privacy professionals, our compliance team, just


00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:25.640
answering questions of just like, Hey, here's a gigantic graph of all of our


00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.240
tables, all of our databases, just everything we could possibly be doing.


00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.920
Like, how does data flow through here?


00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.000
Like explain to me how this PI goes from here to here and what it's used for exactly.


00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.680
And that kind of, as we talked about before, it scales, sorry, it should be, I think, just DBT.


00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.120
Yeah.


00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:42.680
That's the wrong one.


00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:42.960
I know.


00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.960
probably happens.


00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.960
I'll find it.


00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.960
Keep going.


00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.480
And, but that's not really scalable.


00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.560
So again, we talked about before this ended up punishing smaller companies a lot more


00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:57.760
because so if you're Google, you can throw, you can just hire 20 people out of nowhere,


00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.720
call them privacy engineers and you know, just say, Hey, it is now your full time job


00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:05.040
to just keep track of these things and help us stay compliant.


00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.080
But if you're a smaller company like we were, then a lot of that fell to like myself and


00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.080
the data engineering team.


00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.040
And then of course the product engineers as well.


00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.760
And so that makes it really difficult. That adds a pretty large burden to doing business.


00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.920
And after being there for a while, I then had an opportunity to come work at Ethica. And


00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:25.880
I was absolutely sold on working at Ethica when they said, "We're trying to build a platform


00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:31.080
that allows engineers to just handle this like engineers like to," which is with automated


00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:36.520
tooling, with CI checks, with open source. Yeah, with the YAML files, with open source Python code.


00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.760
And I was like, "Hey, this sounds great. I'm spending most of my day worrying about this


00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:44.760
anyway, I'd love to just get paid to solve this problem for other people. And that's


00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:49.720
how I ended up at Ethica. And it's been been a journey ever since. And I think we're one


00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.240
of the challenges of tackling something like this is like we just talked about. It's such


00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.640
a broad problem space. So you can come in and you can handle the cookie consent thing,


00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.880
right? But then they're gonna say, well, to have a holistic private solution, we also


00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.880
need to handle knowing what our code does, and data mapping and DSRs, which you know,


00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.840
we're going to get to a second. So there's actually, it's like this multi-prong...


00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:11.720
- DSR data, what's the DSR stand for?


00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.480
- Yeah, so DSR is data subject request, and that is--


00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.760
- Is that like what data you have about me kind of thing?


00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.600
- Exactly, exactly.


00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.480
So I think one that people have probably heard before


00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.720
is there's also like the right to be forgotten


00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.540
is included in that.


00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.920
So that's the ability for me to go to a company and say,


00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.040
"Hey, I would like to see what data you have about me."


00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.240
And so you actually, I'm gonna give you my email, right?


00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.920
And that's my primary identifier on your system.


00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:35.120
I'm gonna give you my email,


00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.920
And then you need to go scour your entire infrastructure


00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.840
and every piece of PII and data you have related to me,


00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.460
you need to get back to me in like a CSV format


00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:46.720
so that I can very easily see what you're tracking.


00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.640
Then you have, like I said, the right to be forgotten.


00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:52.460
So that is, you know, say I'm using BigCo's


00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:53.760
whatever email service


00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:55.200
and I don't want to use their service anymore.


00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.700
And I say, hey, I'm sending you a request to delete


00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.960
all any and all data related to myself.


00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.440
So I no longer want to be your customer.


00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:03.520
I've deleted my account.


00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.000
everything with, you know, john@somecompany.com.


00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
You need to take that email, run it through your system


00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.640
and delete every single piece of PII related to it.


00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.480
- Yeah.


00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.300
- And so these are the,


00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.140
these are kind of like privacy protections


00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.400
we're talking about, but that stuff is, is complicated.


00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.480
And so.


00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:19.320
- Yeah.


00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.400
Well, I talked earlier about how it was really challenging


00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:24.080
for small, small companies.


00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.480
I think this thing you're talking about now is,


00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.280
it's actually not that bad for small companies.


00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.720
I think it's killer for the medium sized business


00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:34.360
that doesn't have the Google sized tech team to track it.


00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:35.200
- Right.


00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.520
- They've got a ton of people that mess with it


00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:37.360
and a ton of data.


00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.040
- Yeah, and a lot of complexity.


00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.440
- A lot of integrations, yeah.


00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.680
- Yeah, and that's an interesting thing we've seen


00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.600
is that a lot of times when people are out of compliance,


00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.840
it's not actually because they are malicious


00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.560
and they don't care about people's privacy.


00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:55.620
It is because they just, they physically cannot.


00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.880
If you go to someone and say,


00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:58.160
"Hey, you have a hundred thousand,"


00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:01.200
This is not uncommon, like 100,000 Postgres tables.


00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.160
And you need to tell me exactly where every bit of PI


00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.720
is in those 100,000 Postgres tables.


00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:07.840
It's not going to happen.


00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.280
No one actually knows.


00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.640
There's probably people that have left that may be new.


00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.560
And now there's some dangling Postgres database out there


00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.920
in AWS somewhere that has PIs they don't even know about.


00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:17.880
Just doesn't even show up on their maps anymore.


00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:19.260
And that's the biggest challenge,


00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:23.080
is that it's not people doing things out of malice.


00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.320
It is purely the technical scale of the problem that's


00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.240
just huge.


00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:29.080
And again, like I said, even Google


00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.880
with an army of privacy engineers


00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.160
or Meta with an army of privacy engineers,


00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:34.680
they still get fined all the time


00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.640
because it's just not really possible


00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:38.600
to catch everything manually at that scale.


00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.120
And that's what most people are still trying to do


00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.560
is to do everything manually.


00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:45.320
- This portion of Talk Python to Me


00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.360
is brought to you by Sentry.


00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.760
Is your Python application fast


00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.040
or does it sometimes suffer from slowdowns


00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.160
and unexpected latency?


00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.360
Does this usually only happen in production?


00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.140
It's really tough to track down the problems


00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.840
at that point, isn't it?


00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.180
If you've looked at APM,


00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.720
Application Performance Monitoring products before,


00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.120
they may have felt out of place for software teams.


00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.900
Many of them are more focused on legacy problems


00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.860
made for ops and infrastructure teams


00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:14.340
to keep their infrastructure and services up and running.


00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:18.520
Sentry has just launched their new APM service.


00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.760
And Sentry's approach to application monitoring


00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:23.340
is focused on being actionable, affordable,


00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:25.600
and actually built for developers.


00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.000
Whether it's a slow running query


00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.080
or latent payment endpoint that's at risk


00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.340
of timing out and causing sales to tank,


00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.240
Sentry removes the complexity


00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.220
and does the analysis for you,


00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:37.480
surfacing the most critical performance issues


00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.280
so you can address them immediately.


00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:41.320
Most legacy APM tools focus on


00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.480
an ingest everything approach,


00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.320
resulting in high storage costs, noisy environments,


00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.720
and an enormous amount of telemetry data


00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.840
most developers will never need to analyze.


00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.720
Sentry has taken a different approach,


00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.040
building the most affordable APM solution in the market.


00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.800
They remove the noise and extract the maximum value


00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:00.980
out of your performance data


00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.700
while passing the savings directly onto you,


00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.640
especially for Talk Python listeners


00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.920
who use the code Talk Python.


00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.120
So get started at talkpython.fm/sentry


00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.860
and be sure to use their code, Talk Python, all lowercase,


00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:18.000
so you let them know that you heard about them from us.


00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.800
My thanks to Sentry for keeping this podcast going strong.


00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:26.040
What about bad actors?


00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:32.040
By that I mean there are companies that try to do the right thing like mine.


00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.040
You can go to the website and there I spent a lot of this part of that two weeks.


00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.640
There's a button download everything you know about me and there's a nuke my


00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.440
account completely wipe me off the face of the earth as far as you're concerned.


00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.640
And to my knowledge those are totally accurate and sufficient.


00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.640
However, what if there's a company that says here's all the data I have with you


00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.240
and here's the places I share it.


00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.640
And they leave out the three most important


00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.680
and dangerous ones.


00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.320
Like, do you know what recourse there is?


00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:00.720
Because it looks like they're complying.


00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:02.400
It looks like I requested the thing,


00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.360
they gave it to me, I asked it to be deleted, they did.


00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.160
Except for in that dark market


00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.280
where they're selling it to shadow brokers


00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.560
for ad data and credit card mix-ins.


00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.600
And that's way more valuable, we'll keep that.


00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.760
- Yeah, I mean, this comes down to


00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.880
somehow they would just have to get found out.


00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.520
There'd have to be an internal whistleblower.


00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:19.920
There'd have to be an investigation.


00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.820
There would have to be some kind of audit


00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.440
because they do, as part of GDPR,


00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.240
you are required to submit things like a data map,


00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.180
which we'll talk about in a little bit,


00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:31.060
which is basically, where is data going?


00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.320
What is our valid use for said data


00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.800
and all that kinds of stuff.


00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.520
But like you said, if there's a truly bad actor


00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:39.120
that is leaving things out of reports on purpose


00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.160
and not letting customers know


00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.880
that they're doing certain things with their data,


00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.560
I'm actually not sure how that would get


00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:44.400
kind of discovered. - I think you're right.


00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.280
Maybe a whistleblower or maybe somebody says,


00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.800
"There's no way this data got over there


00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.520
without going through there until I'm--


00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:51.360
- Right, exactly.


00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.120
- I'm gonna try to get some legal recourse


00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.680
to like make you show us, make you testify,


00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:57.840
at least lie under oath.


00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.680
(laughing)


00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.560
Instead of lie to you.


00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.600
- And even this was,


00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.520
this actually was a big sticking point recently.


00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:06.680
Florida's also, you know, working on their own privacy law


00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.760
and a big sticking point that I believe


00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.080
may not go through was that they could not agree


00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.840
on whether individual citizens should be allowed


00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.400
to sue companies for data misuse


00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.120
or if it should be purely something the government handles.


00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.640
And I think that's, that's an interesting thing to think about.


00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.040
It is.


00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.520
It's one of those things that sounds amazing.


00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.400
Like, yes, sure.


00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.840
If you're abusing, you know, company X is abusing Thomas, Thomas


00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.520
should have some direct recourse.


00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.720
But you could easily destroy a company just by going like, let's


00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:35.300
give 50 people to all like, here's your cookie cutter letter that we send


00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:39.300
over as part of the legal process and, you know, just knock them offline.


00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:39.560
Right.


00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:40.600
Knock them out of business.


00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.280
So I, I can see both sides all that all over again.


00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:43.720
All right.


00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.680
So I kind of derailed you.


00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:49.160
we were talking about like the types of things that these medium scale


00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.280
organizations like really get hung up on and you touched on some, but.


00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:54.920
Yeah. So sorry. Let me, yeah, I'll, I'll go back.


00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.480
So number one is just the, the, the largest issue that we see in this scale is


00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.360
actually anywhere from medium to large, right.


00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.320
Even with Google and you'll probably have Twitter size, you know,


00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.240
kind of the thing I would also bet really good money.


00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.880
There's no one there that really knows where everything is. It's just,


00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:13.920
it's just too much to, to handle manually or within people's heads.


00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.520
So the number one problem is that people don't know where their data is.


00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.320
That's a huge issue.


00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:21.080
The number two problem is even if they know where all that data is, right?


00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.560
Theoretically in a perfect world, if someone gives you an email and says,


00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:29.320
Hey, you need to delete this email across all of your tables.


00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:34.240
And okay, I know we have this email and this PI and a hundred tables and three


00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:37.520
different APIs that we use because we use whatever Zendesk and Salesforce.


00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:37.940
Okay.


00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.000
So now you've got that information in a perfect world.


00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.400
How do you actually execute that?


00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:46.880
Like there are plenty of companies that have someone on staff full time that just fulfills these


00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:50.800
DSRs and right to be forgotten and things like that. So it is not really efficient to say,


00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:56.720
okay, I've now got to manually go run SQL queries in 100 different, you know, database tables,


00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.520
100 different databases, I've now got to log into three different API's. And it's just, it's not,


00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:06.320
it's again, not doable in an automated, you know, you need to automate it. Yeah, basically,


00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.160
I'm trying to say, so even if you know, everything is, how do you automate that? So that's another


00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:13.680
problem we were trying to solve. And then finally, it's the data


00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.520
mapping piece, right? So you need to understand, you not only


00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.680
need to know where your data is, you need to know what type of


00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.080
data is and why you have it. And that's really difficult. Because


00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.200
maybe three years ago, I did some proof of concept where I


00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:29.400
was grabbing people's addresses and trying to figure out a way


00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.880
to find cheaper shipping for our e commerce website. And whatever


00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.800
the table still there. And so then three years later, someone


00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.480
comes in, hey, I found all this PI and database, like, why did


00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.760
you collect this? Like, what is this for? And I've already


00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:43.600
moved on to another company because you know, it's startups. And that's a problem because


00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:47.800
you need to have a valid use for every bit of PI that you have in your system. And so


00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:53.080
it's this kind of this lack of documentation and knowledge that just brings about all these


00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.900
problems. And again, without automated tooling, it's just, I just don't think it's really


00:35:56.900 --> 00:36:01.520
feasible, which is kind of again, where Ethica saw a place to solve a huge problem.


00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:06.640
Probably also a little fear. By that I mean, the time, the short times that I spent at


00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.000
at these larger companies, there were systems that were like, don't touch that.


00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.160
Runs.


00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.320
It's important.


00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.480
Nobody can make it.


00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.840
Nobody can fix it.


00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.520
We probably can't redeploy it.


00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.920
Just don't touch it.


00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:20.040
And what if it, what if it has a bit of data?


00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.120
It cannot have a nullable foreign key relationship.


00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:27.480
No, that's a strong, and I want to remove it from this table, but, but the thing


00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.960
that shall not be touched and no one can keep it running, it's my problem.


00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:33.480
If I break it, I don't want that problem.


00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.840
I could just stay.


00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.280
Yeah.


00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.040
That's a problem.


00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:36.600
Right.


00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.240
Yeah, that definitely becomes a problem too.


00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.020
Things that get forgotten about, things that people don't want to touch, things they've


00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:46.420
lost kind of the institutional knowledge of how it got there, and how to even get out


00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.420
of it if they wanted to.


00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:51.140
Like you said, fear of downstream breaking changes, right?


00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:56.740
So say I come in and mask this username, I have no idea what it's going to break some


00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:59.900
analytics tool, if it's going to ruin our marketing department, like I have no idea,


00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:00.900
right?


00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:01.900
Right.


00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:02.900
Why can't we send email anymore?


00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:03.900
Well, you see.


00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:04.900
Yeah, exactly.


00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:10.540
And so it's also this difficulty of communicating across the organization.


00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:15.620
Because oftentimes you'll get privacy engineers, and they'll be embedded into a product, into


00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:16.620
a team.


00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.540
And theoretically, this is just to talk across the entire org, but there's not like some


00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.060
centralized tool.


00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:25.460
There's no Zendesk of privacy where like, okay, a whole organization uses this one tool,


00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:30.340
and we can put in tickets, or we can see what the state of privacy is across the organization,


00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.940
et cetera, things like that.


00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.340
There's nothing like that that really existed.


00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:39.860
And so that's when we kind of realized, okay, we need to build some kind of platform where


00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:43.700
it can just be like a one-stop shop for everything privacy engineering related.


00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.260
So that's going to be engineers and privacy professionals.


00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:47.540
The engineers do their work.


00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.340
It all flows upwards into this tool.


00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.540
And then the compliance professionals can get all the information they need out of that


00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:56.180
tool and trust that it's correct because it's done in a programmatic way.


00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:59.500
And it's automated and all the stuff that you need, right?


00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.500
Yeah.


00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:01.500
All right.


00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.260
Now, really one final question before we jump into your platform, which solves many of these


00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:08.900
problems. What about AI? What if it learned something through personal


00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:13.620
information and then you ask for your personal information? You can't go


00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:18.340
and show me like the node in the neural network that has my information.


00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.300
But at the same time it knows something about it, right?


00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:28.660
Correct. Yeah, so it is trained. There are different ways to deal with this. So for


00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:32.780
instance, but like you said, you can never really know. So I mean this is rabbit


00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:39.780
So you can use AI to generate fake PII and then train a model on fake generated PII.


00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:40.780
That's one way to do it.


00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:41.780
Right, right, right.


00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.780
But again, like you said, due to the very opaque nature of, and like you said, we're


00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.780
talking about actual neural nets.


00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.780
We're not just talking about machine learning, statistical learning models.


00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.780
It's like a neural network, that stuff becomes completely obfuscated.


00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.780
Probably like mid-journey, dolly, these types of things.


00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:54.780
Yeah, exactly.


00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:55.780
Yeah, it becomes truly a black box.


00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:57.780
There's really no way to know, right?


00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:58.620
to know, right?


00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:01.060
And that comes down to regulators stepping in


00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.940
and again, just saying, hey, you cannot use


00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.260
- Yeah. - AI in this model,


00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:07.940
regardless of the fact that eventually,


00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.940
theoretically, it would be obfuscated.


00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.760
You know, that comes down to governments just say,


00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.700
hey, that's not cool regardless.


00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:15.780
- It's gonna be so interesting as this evolves


00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.220
'cause if it was trained on that information,


00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:20.380
it kind of is corrupted in a sense,


00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.800
like you can't take one person's information out,


00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.640
you'd have to redo the model. - Exactly.


00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.860
- That's so much work. - Exactly.


00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:25.900
- Yeah, it's so tricky. - Exactly.


00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:27.220
So you got to think of that up front.


00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.500
So, all right.


00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:31.460
So let's talk about your project, Fides.


00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.100
Tell us about Fides.


00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:33.940
- Absolutely.


00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.660
So Fides is an open source, I guess, tool for,


00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.340
platform maybe is a better word for it,


00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.580
an open source platform for privacy engineering.


00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:46.820
And it's really designed towards those two personas


00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:47.660
that I've talked about,


00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:49.100
where you have privacy professionals,


00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.100
you have a compliance team,


00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:53.060
and they need an easier and a more accurate way


00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:55.080
to interface and work with the engineering team,


00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:57.120
other than just calling cons of Zoom calls to ask them,


00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.200
hey, what does this table do?


00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.200
Which again, is fine.


00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.040
Like that's their job.


00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.520
They're supposed to be doing that for protecting the company


00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.760
and protecting the privacy of the user's data.


00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.160
But then on the other side, you have engineers


00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.960
and engineers, they probably don't want to be


00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.200
in these Zoom calls all the time.


00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.520
And they would probably much rather interface


00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.980
with privacy engineering in a way


00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:14.000
that's more familiar with them.


00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.960
So CI checks, command line tools,


00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.640
YAML files, like we mentioned.


00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:20.960
And so we thought, okay, we need to build a tool


00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.140
that bridges that gap, right?


00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:26.540
Like we need to create an overlapping set of tools


00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:27.740
that both sides will be happy with


00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:30.220
and that provide a good user experience for both sides.


00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.060
And so we have Fides, right?


00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.460
So Fides is primarily Python.


00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:35.300
Pretty much everything's in Python.


00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:37.660
We also have TypeScript for the front end.


00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.460
We use a lot of other open source stuff


00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.340
and we're also on GitHub.


00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:45.580
So anyone that wants to use this for themselves


00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:47.640
is totally able to, right?


00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.180
Because we kind of fundamentally,


00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.140
I think as a privacy company,


00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:52.980
it's important to believe that privacy is a human right.


00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:55.280
While we do have some paid features,


00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:58.340
the vast majority are completely available,


00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:02.060
like compliance is completely available for free and open source.


00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:03.540
We don't think we should be saying, "Hey,


00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:04.780
your privacy is really important,


00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:06.980
but only if you pay us."


00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:09.900
But we think any engineers should be able to come and look at


00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:14.420
our repo and grab FIDAs and then start working off of it and be


00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.360
able to respect user privacy within


00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.040
their applications without having to really pay anything.


00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.320
- Right, and since you brought it up,


00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.960
so Fides is this open source project


00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.240
that people can grab and fulfill and automate


00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.920
much of what we've been talking about here,


00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.080
which is awesome. - Correct.


00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:34.580
- And your business model with Ethica is,


00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:37.800
I guess what you would probably classify as open core, right?


00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.700
Like, you sell-- - Yeah, that's how we refer


00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:40.680
to it internally. - Is that how you


00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:42.720
consider it, yeah? - Yeah, open core.


00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.020
So we have, internally we'll call it Fides core, right,


00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.540
which is this repo, which is where a lot of the work,


00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:51.680
it's not like you'll see me, most of my PRs are in there.


00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:53.500
So FIDO's core is really what we build on.


00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:57.420
And then we have an additional, what we call FIDO's plus.


00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.120
And that is where you would get additional features


00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.780
that are really more like enterprise focused, right?


00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.100
So if you are, like I said,


00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.060
we're talking about those medium to very large enterprises


00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.200
where you have a hundred thousand tables


00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.620
and maybe you want a machine learning classifier


00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:13.700
to help you figure out what kind of data is in those tables,


00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:16.000
then like that'd be a paid feature.


00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.720
- But if you just want to-- - Like you kind of bootstrap it,


00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.280
like, "We have this data, go look at it


00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.480
and tell me what you think about it."


00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:22.360
Something like that?


00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.800
- Yes, exactly, exactly.


00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.960
So it'll walk databases, tables, fields,


00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.280
all that kind of stuff, and say,


00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.760
"Hey, this is probably this type of data,


00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.120
this is probably this type of data."


00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:33.680
You know, obviously as accurate as we can get it.


00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:35.560
With the most part, things are going to be happening


00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.400
in OpenCore.


00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.760
So in the OpenCore product, we are going to tackle


00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:44.760
the three major things that we think are gonna be required


00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.120
for any kind of privacy first application.


00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:50.180
So first we're going to let people,


00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.420
and you can see for all the YouTube viewers,


00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.480
video viewers on the right side,


00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.440
here we've got YAML files.


00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.400
So YAML files are where you're gonna define


00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.040
kind of the primitives you wanna use for your application.


00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.200
So we have like data uses,


00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.880
we have different data category types,


00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.500
and you can define systems, data sets,


00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:07.280
kind of the building blocks of how you're going to describe


00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.440
and define your application from a privacy perspective.


00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.640
Once you've done that, right,


00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.960
once we have all this information


00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.040
that you've given us as metadata,


00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.200
you've given us about your application and your datasets,


00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.960
we're then able to start enforcing that automatically.


00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:22.960
We're able to start building those data maps and telling you,


00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.440
"Hey, based on what you told us in your metadata annotations,


00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.040
this is everywhere your data lives and


00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.800
this is the type of data that lives there."


00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.800
Additionally, based on those, we're going to say,


00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.260
"Hey, if you give us an e-mail,


00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:36.320
we have actually an execution engine


00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.680
with a bunch of different connectors."


00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.280
We're going to say, "Okay, so you've told us you have


00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.660
a Postgres database here and you have a Mongo database here,


00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:46.660
and we're looking for this email and these tables are going to be where the PII is.


00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:51.620
So it'll automatically go and execute that. It's built on top of Dask, but we're doing


00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:56.180
our own logic for some directed acyclic graph to go out and find that data and delete it in


00:43:56.180 --> 00:44:00.020
the right order or to retrieve it in the right order and then give it to user request.


00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:06.260
So we're really leveraging this power of using metadata to go ahead and automate all these tasks.


00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:10.340
We'll also, more and more as we go into the future, we're trying to figure out ways to


00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:14.460
just automate it completely. So if we got to a point where engineers didn't even have


00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:20.280
to write these YAML files, and we could just introspect the code and figure out quite programmatically


00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:23.700
what was actually going on there, what we need to be concerned about, that's kind of


00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:27.920
where we want to get to and where we see the future of privacy being, especially with the


00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.240
incredible explosion of these large language models and things like chat, you begin OpenAI,


00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.220
doing some kind of natural language processing to allow us to understand what the code is


00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:39.500
doing without burdening developers with writing YAML is where we hope to get to eventually


00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:40.500
as well.


00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:45.340
That's, that's ambitious, but five years ago, I would have said, Oh, that's insane.


00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:51.180
Anymore, you give these large language models, good chunks of code, and they have a really


00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.820
deep understanding of what's happening.


00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:53.820
It's right.


00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.240
It's Yeah, so it's very impressive.


00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:58.300
So for now, we're still in we're still in the animal land.


00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:59.820
Hopefully engineers are pretty comfortable there.


00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.060
We've been there for a while, I think with Kubernetes and all kinds of other tools.


00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:07.740
But yeah, hopefully we just we just want to keep lowering the barrier to entry for for


00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:10.180
for privacy compliance and for, you know,


00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:13.280
building applications that are private by design.


00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.120
- Right.


00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.540
So in the parlance of your all's website,


00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.860
that's privacy checks as code and continuous integration.


00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:23.460
The two other things are programmatic subject requests


00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:25.480
and automated data mapping.


00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.500
It sounded like you touched on the automated data mapping,


00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.580
but talk about the programmatic subject.


00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.460
- Yeah, so the programmatic subject request


00:45:31.460 --> 00:45:34.220
is what I mentioned briefly about kind of how we build


00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:38.060
an execution graph for when those data requests come in.


00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.620
Again, like I said, we have that metadata,


00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.220
we know where your data lives and what type of data it is.


00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:44.020
When a user says, "Hey,


00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.660
here's my e-mail, please get rid of


00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:47.260
all the information you have about me."


00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:48.940
We're able to do that subject for us


00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:50.620
programmatically because we know,


00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:53.300
okay, we're going to reach out to the Salesforce API,


00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.780
we're going to reach out to this Postgres database,


00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:57.900
users table where we know that data lives.


00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.020
We're going to do that for you automatically because like I


00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:01.860
mentioned before, there are plenty of


00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:07.700
relatively large and relatively small enterprises where there is someone on staff full time


00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:11.620
waiting for these emails to come in. And then they say, "Okay, this email needs to get deleted."


00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.980
And I've done this before, so I'm not above this. When I was a data engineer, we had to do this as


00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:20.180
well in Snowflake, right? You know, something comes in and they say, "Okay, I've got this email. Now


00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:24.980
I need to go to these 20 systems and run all these manual scripts and hope that I don't do it in the


00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.780
wrong order." Because like you said, if there's like foreign key constraints, you need to know


00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:31.340
about that. Because if you do it the wrong word, it's going to mess things up. So we


00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.420
basically handle that for you based on the metadata.


00:46:34.420 --> 00:46:38.820
Cannot complete transaction. There's a foreign key constraint violation. Sorry.


00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:42.060
Correct. Right. It's like knowing that and being able to figure that out, that stuff


00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:46.060
is important. So we will handle that. And then, like I mentioned with the data mapping.


00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:51.140
So this is really, really important for compliance professionals, because this is kind of like


00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.580
their bread and butter. Like they have to be able to produce these data maps to show


00:46:54.580 --> 00:47:00.180
compliance with GDPR. And that's going to show all the systems, you know, within their application,


00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:04.180
within their enterprise, and then what those systems are doing and with what kind of data.


00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:08.660
And that's really, really important. And again, we can generate all this based off of the YAML file.


00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:14.340
And for engineers, the thing that we have is what we call privacy checks to CI code,


00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:19.220
or privacy checks as code in CI, where we're shifting privacy left, kind of the same way that


00:47:19.220 --> 00:47:23.860
we saw with security, right? Where you went from, okay, we push the application out, and now a


00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:26.500
a security team is just going to play with the production version and figure out where


00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:27.500
there are problems.


00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:28.500
Right.


00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.340
We're going to disregard security and give it to you.


00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.820
And then you tell us how you broke it.


00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:32.820
Yeah, basically.


00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:33.820
Yeah.


00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.860
But that's how a lot of companies treat privacy now too is like, we'll kind of figure it out


00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:37.860
on production, right?


00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:41.020
Like ship it, we'll figure it out on production.


00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:46.180
And now you see, oh, actually, there are really great static analysis tools for code, right?


00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:50.420
You have Snyk, you have, you know, various other open source versions that were like,


00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:53.580
let's we're going to scan your code before this commit even.


00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.280
Are you leaking secrets?


00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.500
Have you stored anything that maybe you shouldn't be?


00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.060
We're trying to do that for privacy as well.


00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:04.100
We're shifting privacy left and based on this metadata,


00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.980
and based on the policies you defined,


00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:08.300
we can say, "Hey, you've added this new feature


00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:10.380
and you've annotated in YAML,


00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:13.540
and now you're stating that this system is using


00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.340
user data for third-party advertising,


00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:17.920
and we're going to fail your CI check.


00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.940
We're going to throw an error and say,


00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.540
"Hey, there's a violation here of this privacy policy


00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:23.740
that your company has,


00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:27.260
because you define you're using user data in this way,


00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:28.780
and that's gonna break that."


00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.420
So again, that's just a way to short circuit


00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:34.800
that whole thing of, okay, the engineers have shipped it,


00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:36.440
and now someone comes running back and says,


00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.860
"Hey, hey, why did you ship this?


00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.420
You're using personal data


00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:40.700
in a way you're not supposed to be."


00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.380
We're trying to kind of get around that by saying,


00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.860
pretty early on, we'll know what's going on,


00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:50.180
and we can avoid pushes to main or deploys


00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.820
that don't pass the CI checks.


00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:56.620
- Okay, so as an engineer writing software in this,


00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:01.380
guarded by this, it's my, I have to be proactive


00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:02.740
and state how I'm using data


00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.300
if I'm bringing new data into the system


00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.940
or does it somehow get discovered?


00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:08.580
- No, so that is currently what is required


00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:12.260
is it is up to the engineers to maintain that YAML.


00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:14.940
So we're working on ways to automate that.


00:49:14.940 --> 00:49:16.900
We actually have automated it for datasets


00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.980
because it's obviously much more programmatic.


00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.420
If you say, "Hey, here's my application database,


00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.720
here's my Postgres database,


00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:28.020
and I've annotated every field and all that stuff."


00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.940
We can automatically scan that and we say, "Hey,


00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.180
in your YAML definition,


00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.300
you've left out these two columns,"


00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:36.340
which maybe you added in this PR.


00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.300
Before that PR goes in, it's going to remind you,


00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.380
"Hey, you need to add these two new columns to


00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:43.500
your dataset.yaml file so that we know what's


00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:45.840
going on in those new database columns.


00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:47.940
- Okay, I can see how you might do a lot of,


00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:49.860
sorry, I can see how you might do a lot of introspection,


00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:52.660
like, oh, I'm using SQL model


00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:55.180
and here's the Pydantic thing describing the table


00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.660
and here's the two new things,


00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:00.400
but then you could also traverse the usages


00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.380
of those two columns and see where they're used elsewhere


00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:07.020
and possibly, is there any API call


00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:09.740
that is like that data is being passed to, for example?


00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.460
And like, oh, is it coming out of--


00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:12.300
- Exactly.


00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.260
All right, you might be able to find the common integrations


00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.660
and see what's happening there.


00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:18.140
- Yeah, that's exactly what we're looking at next.


00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:21.020
Like I said, looking for ways to automate this, right?


00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:24.100
So even if we just had a really basic dictionary of like,


00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:27.540
hey, these APIs are gonna be related to storing


00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:29.380
or sending user data, right?


00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.580
And making sure that's annotated.


00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:32.260
And like you said, maybe some of those


00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:34.860
code level annotations we're using,


00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:36.700
like if you think about Pydantic, right?


00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.220
Where you can have the field object


00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:39.580
and you can define, okay, here's a field,


00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:43.000
Here's the default, here's the description.


00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.580
And then if there was another field that was like,


00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:47.020
privacy category, data category, whatever,


00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.660
data use or data subject, something like that,


00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:52.220
that's absolutely something we've been looking at as well


00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.680
of kind of like the next step,


00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.620
because we know, again, this comes down to,


00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:57.340
this is still partially manual


00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:01.000
and therefore still potentially error prone.


00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.900
So as long as we're scanning databases,


00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:05.340
that gives us some guarantee that, okay,


00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.640
there's probably not gonna be an entirely new thing


00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.960
that we miss out on.


00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.320
But if it's sending you like third party APIs or something,


00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:13.400
it would still be possible.


00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.900
So that's kind of the holy grail we're trying to get to is,


00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:17.960
how do we just make this even easier for developers?


00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.520
How do we lower the barrier even further?


00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:22.000
Because we know this is still somewhat of a barrier


00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.080
to entry, but also hopefully still a huge step up


00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.080
from nothing.


00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:27.560
- Yeah, no, it's great.


00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:30.960
And if your job is to put together a system


00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.760
that can explain how it's using data


00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.920
and how that's enforced and how you're checking that,


00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:39.520
then something like this seems way better than code review.


00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:42.160
Not instead of, but it's certainly a huge bonus.


00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:44.280
- Yeah, correct, in addition to.


00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:47.080
- Yeah, so what we discussed here,


00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:50.480
this part feels like a GitHub Action type of plugin


00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:54.240
as part of a CI step or something along those lines.


00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.600
What about the other one?


00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.320
So for example, the programmatic subject request


00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.280
that's gonna cruise through the data


00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:01.360
and pull out the things,


00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:02.560
either show people what they got


00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.560
'cause they asked for it or delete it.


00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.360
Is that, like, how does that run?


00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.160
Is that something you plug into your app?


00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.520
Is that a service that just has access to your data?


00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.120
- Yeah, so that would be something,


00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:17.800
so we actually do have a hosted version of Vitez, right?


00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.280
So for companies that don't want to bother


00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.000
kind of hosting their own, you know,


00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.720
a database and web server and things of that nature,


00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.640
we host it.


00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.820
But all this is stuff that you could self host as well.


00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:29.520
Like you can deploy in your own instance.


00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.400
So we have something called the Privacy Center,


00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.620
which again is a thing that you spin up


00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:39.500
you run on your side that actually would then link to and that is then what would direct


00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:43.860
the privacy requests to your backend FIDO's web server instance.


00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:47.300
And then that's where you would go and you would go, we call it the admin UI, right?


00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:49.940
Like the admin would log in or the privacy professional log in, they would see, oh, these


00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:51.300
are all the requests that have come in.


00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:55.020
I can approve these, I can deny these, et cetera, et cetera, based on what's going on


00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:56.020
there.


00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:57.020
Yeah.


00:52:57.020 --> 00:53:00.860
So we have the kind of the pre-deployment of the code would be the checks in CI and


00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:02.580
writing all those YAML files.


00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:04.420
And then once you deploy the application,


00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:06.300
we have these runtime tools, like you said,


00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:07.460
these subject requests,


00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.340
and that's all stuff you would deploy.


00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:11.500
Most people would do it doing Docker containers


00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:13.740
that we build and publish,


00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:16.380
or you could just download it and run it directly,


00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.220
pip install.


00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:18.960
- Yeah, okay, interesting.


00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:22.100
So basically there's a web app that you log into


00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.540
and you can either self-toast it or that can be yours


00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:28.340
and then it goes and does its magic at that part.


00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.320
What about the data mapping bit?


00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:33.440
- Yeah, and the data mapping is something


00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:36.400
where you can either log into the web portal,


00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:39.680
because again, we assume that most privacy professionals,


00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:40.800
most of them have legal backgrounds


00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.400
are probably not gonna wanna mess with command line tool.


00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:44.600
Although we do have a command line tool, right?


00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:45.760
For the engineers.


00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.880
So if you're an engineer,


00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:49.360
you can of course run a command line,


00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:54.320
command that will give you the properly formatted,


00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:56.920
Excel document or CSV if you want it


00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:59.800
with all of the rows in there that you need,


00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:01.400
Or again, like I said, if you're a privacy professional,


00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.760
you can log in with UI and download it that way.


00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:04.960
And just have it generate it.


00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.600
It'll hit an endpoint and then it will just


00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:07.560
give you the file back.


00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.380
- Okay, seems really neat.


00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:13.600
You talked a bit about this, like automated checks


00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.400
with looking at the code to try to reduce the need


00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.280
for explicitly stating how things work.


00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:21.200
And you've got this ML higher order piece


00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:24.040
that will hunt down the private information.


00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:27.200
Where else are you, what's the roadmap beyond those things?


00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.100
Where is it going?


00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.200
Just as much as you can talk.


00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:31.940
Yeah, yeah.


00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:33.860
I mean, just more and more automation, right?


00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:38.100
Because again, if we look at the ultimate goal is how do we just


00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.500
make privacy easier?


00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:40.660
Because it's not going away.


00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:42.660
It's only going to get more stringent.


00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:44.280
The fines are only going to get bigger.


00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.060
I think it's interesting that that kind of GDPR fine list


00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.420
ended in May.


00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:49.420
Was it May or something?


00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:50.580
March 2022.


00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:53.300
Since then, fines have actually only been getting bigger.


00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:55.660
They're basically making fines larger and larger and larger


00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:56.900
because they realize that tech companies just


00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:57.900
don't care for the most part.


00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.700
And so it's becoming more and more dangerous for people that aren't compliant.


00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:03.260
So, okay, how do we just make this as easy as possible?


00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:06.820
We know that there are people that probably don't want to maintain a bunch of YAML.


00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:10.620
So it's really just anything along those lines of how do we lower the barrier to entry


00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:14.220
for people that want to be privacy compliant and use Vita.


00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:19.740
So like you said, that's going to take the form of probably more machine learning models,


00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:22.700
NLP models that are going to help us introspect the code.


00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:26.660
It could be things like the in code annotations, right?


00:55:26.660 --> 00:55:28.460
where like, okay, maybe there's now,


00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:31.660
in Pydantic there's now a field to add privacy information


00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:34.220
or maybe in dbt, the analytics we talked about before,


00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:36.660
Geno's used by a lot of companies.


00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:37.980
Maybe we add metadata in there


00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.140
where people can now define what PI is being used in there


00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.340
and then we can just kind of natively read from those files


00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:44.780
instead of having to have our own file format,


00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:45.680
things of that nature.


00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:48.500
Really, we're just looking at any possible place


00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:49.960
and getting feedback from people


00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:51.220
of where their pain points are


00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.900
and how we can help solve them.


00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:53.740
- Sure.


00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:56.420
Do you have any runtime things that you're thinking about?


00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:58.940
You've got the deploy stuff with the YAML.


00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:01.700
You've got the on request stuff with the other things,


00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:05.380
but we saw this JSON document come in.


00:56:05.380 --> 00:56:06.780
It has to be called email.


00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:07.880
We don't know.


00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:09.660
- Yeah, so interesting you ask that.


00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:13.620
So we have done some research since improved concepts.


00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:16.260
I don't know if you're familiar with something called eBPF.


00:56:16.260 --> 00:56:18.740
It is a way, yeah, eBPF.


00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:21.620
So it's a way to, I believe it's in Linux kernels,


00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:26.380
to actually monitor the traffic going back and forth


00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.540
between basically over the network.


00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:32.700
What we've been able to do is,


00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:35.340
if you have an application running in Kubernetes,


00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:37.900
then we'll deploy something called a system scanner.


00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:40.100
It is runtime and what it's doing is it'll actually


00:56:40.100 --> 00:56:41.580
watch the traffic that's


00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:43.860
happening across your application in Kubernetes,


00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:45.900
and it will come back to you and say,


00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:47.940
"Hey, you've got these systems.


00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:49.700
They're talking to each other in this way,"


00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:51.980
and basically build a map automatically.


00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:53.420
This is a really useful tool


00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.380
for you're already running everything,


00:56:55.380 --> 00:56:58.700
and you just want someone to tell you what you have running


00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:00.260
and kind of build the topography for you,


00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.620
tell you all your systems, tell you all your datasets,


00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:04.900
tell you what the traffic looks like across your application,


00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:08.100
then yes, we are working on a tool that can do this.


00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:12.420
- Okay, yeah, this ebpf@ebpf.io looks nuts.


00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:15.580
Dynamically programmed Linux kernel for efficient networking,


00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:17.260
observability, tracing, and security.


00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.820
And yeah, you could just say things like,


00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:21.460
these are all the outbound connections,


00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:23.540
all of our systems are making.


00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:28.540
And these IP addresses resolve to, we know this one is MailChimp, we know that one's Zendesk.


00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:29.040
What's this one?


00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:29.940
Correct.


00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:30.940
Yeah, exactly.


00:57:30.940 --> 00:57:33.640
So it's like, okay, so we see that we're making a bunch of calls to MailChimp,


00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:37.340
but you haven't, you've never mentioned in your metadata that you're talking to MailChimp.


00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:40.140
We now know that that's something we need to worry about, right?


00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:42.940
So this is also something that we have a little bit more.


00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.340
This is a little bit of what I was thinking about at runtime stuff.


00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:51.640
Like, can you watch the data flow and go, okay, this is inconsistent with what you've told me is happening.


00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:52.640
Yes, exactly.


00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:56.080
So the way it works now is you would deploy our system scanner


00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.640
into your environment, into your Kubernetes environment.


00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:01.680
It just sits off as its own set of nodes,


00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.280
and it does its thing, and then it'll,


00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.160
after a certain amount of time,


00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.000
it'll just come back to you with,


00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.320
hey, this is what we saw, and it'll build you,


00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:09.360
it'll actually build the YAML files for you.


00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.200
- Oh my goodness, okay.


00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:12.360
- And say this is kind of the definition of what we saw.


00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.240
- Very wild.


00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.600
All right, that's cool.


00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.600
That's cool.


00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:19.640
So we're getting real short on time here.


00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:25.760
I guess maybe give us just the quick report or thoughts on how the open


00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:28.020
core business model is going for you all.


00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:33.520
I, I feel like going through the life cycle of this podcast, just had the


00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.500
eight year anniversary for running the podcast.


00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:38.480
I've talked to a lot of people and yeah, thank you very much.


00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:43.580
Eight, eight years ago, it was a lot of, ah, we accept donations and mostly


00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:56.240
To me it looked like what the successful story for open source mostly, at least traditionally at that point, had been, I'm a maintainer or major participant of this important library.


00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:03.840
So I got a really good paying job at a high-end tech company, and high-end tech company gives me 20% time to work back on it.


00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:09.080
Kind of like I've got a benefactor-like employer a little bit.


00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:12.360
And it's moving more and more towards open core and other things.


00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:16.840
I'd say both GitHub sponsors and open core, and then incredibly some like really


00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:19.080
interesting VC stuff that's happening as well.


00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:22.280
Those are not disjointed necessarily.


00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:22.760
Right.


00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:27.160
Anyway, I think a long story short, I think the open core stuff people have really hit


00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:31.640
on with something that's seemed like it's kind of working for sustaining open source.


00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:31.960
Yeah.


00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:35.560
I think we've seen the similar, very similar thing.


00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:40.920
I think that it is really hard to walk that line, but where we've come down on it is,


00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:47.000
with the belief that privacy is a human right, all the tools required to be compliant need to be


00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.640
open source, kind of like full stop. So for instance, like data mapping, that is a legal


00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:56.200
requirement. We're not going to put that behind a paywall. Handling those privacy requests,


00:59:56.200 --> 01:00:00.600
building those graphs and being able to go execute those, that is a requirement. You have to have


01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.200
to have that to be compliant, we're not going to pay all that.


01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.200
That's the line that we're trying to ride.


01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:10.460
Is it, okay, anything that makes it super easy, the machine learning stuff, the kind


01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:14.760
of runtime scanning, all that kind of more advanced stuff that's more cutting edge, more


01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:19.240
R&D, then we'll probably put that on the paid offerings, right?


01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:22.880
But anything required to just get things running, because we know we actually have some very,


01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:26.640
very large companies that are using Fidesz purely open source.


01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.400
They have zero contact with us.


01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.440
don't really have any contact with us. But we know they're using, we know they're using


01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:36.280
feeders regularly to do their internal privacy. And that's, I think that's a good place to


01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:42.640
be right. If, if three years ago when you had to implement GDPR stuff for talkpython.fm,


01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.500
and you stumbled across this tool that could just help you do that, and instead of two


01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:49.440
weeks, it was two or three days, like for me, that still feels like a huge win. And


01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.640
there's still enough, there's still enough enterprise customers who have 100,000 Postgres


01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:57.560
tables that want us to help them classify, right? There's still enough of those people


01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:02.640
out there to make it sustainable. And it's also a competitive advantage. I think it's


01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:08.960
easier. It's easy for people to just think that, "Oh, because it's open source, you're


01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.560
kind of throwing away contracts you would have had otherwise." We've had a lot of people


01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.960
engage with us because we're open source, right?


01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:15.960
Sure.


01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.360
And it's not even that they don't want to pay. They're just saying, "Hey, we like your


01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.600
paid offering, but the fact that you also are open source and you have an open core


01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:25.960
model we can go look at and contribute to and put ideas into, that's really attractive


01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.400
for a lot of engineering teams.


01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.600
Because again, that is one of our target markets.


01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.200
- Yeah, I think traditionally looking back quite a ways,


01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.200
there was, I need a company


01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.380
and a private commercial software behind this.


01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:39.760
So I have a SLA and someone to sue when things go wrong.


01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.720
And that's still, you might be able to do that.


01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.160
You might be able to crush that company


01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.100
'cause they did you wrong,


01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:46.160
but you're still not gonna get your bug fixed


01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.800
and your software working any better because of it, right?


01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:49.640
- Right.


01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.520
- And I think people are starting to see open source


01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.120
as the escape hatch, right?


01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.200
Like I can work with a company


01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:56.440
that has this premium offering on top of open source.


01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:59.520
But if worse come to worse, we'll just fork the repo


01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.640
and keep on living.


01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:01.480
You know what I mean?


01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:05.120
And that's a way more, I think, useful and constructive way


01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.320
than we're gonna try to sue them


01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.360
to make them do our deal, right?


01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.200
- Yeah, exactly.


01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.040
You're talking about privacy engineering


01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.200
is being about risk mitigation, right?


01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.960
Having an open source product


01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.720
is also quite a bit of risk mitigation.


01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:18.440
You know, it gives engineers time to get comfortable with it.


01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.840
Like you said, they can fork it.


01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:23.480
They can, you know, we're very open to pull requests


01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.300
and people opening issues and feature requests


01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:27.140
and things of that nature.


01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:30.940
So it just really makes it a much more pleasant process


01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:33.740
when you're just more transparent and more open,


01:02:33.740 --> 01:02:35.900
people can go and look at the code themselves.


01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.740
They can, if they report a bug,


01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:39.540
they can probably go see it getting fixed in real time,


01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:41.100
et cetera, things like that.


01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.380
I think it's definitely the way


01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:44.820
that I prefer working as an engineer.


01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:46.700
You know, I can't speak for management or anything,


01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.820
but it's definitely more fun to be able to engage


01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:49.980
with the community in that way.


01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:51.780
- Awesome, well, I'm happy to see you all


01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:54.900
making your way in the world


01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:56.420
based on your open source product.


01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.260
That's really cool.


01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:59.340
So I think we're about out of time


01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.740
to keep going on the subject.


01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:02.180
So we'll have to just wrap it up


01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.060
with the final two questions here.


01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:05.940
So if you're gonna write some code,


01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.900
work on Vitez or something else Python based,


01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.220
what editor are you using these days?


01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:12.500
- It's VS Code.


01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.780
I think it was pretty hardcore Vim


01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:18.940
until I think at one point you had someone on your podcast


01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:20.220
who was evangelizing VS Code


01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:21.220
and I went and tried it and I was like,


01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:23.920
So I'm very obviously more productive now.


01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.940
So I've stuck with VS Code ever since then.


01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:27.780
That was great.


01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:29.340
Thank you for doing that.


01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:30.180
- Yeah, you bet.


01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.760
And a notable PyPI package.


01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:35.540
- Yeah, I'm gonna give two here pretty quickly.


01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:37.260
So the first one is Knox.


01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:39.300
I think I also learned about it from this podcast.


01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:43.040
This is, I do talk Python.fm driven development.


01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:47.100
Anyway, so we were using, you know, make files before,


01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:48.700
'cause I do a lot of work


01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.220
on the kind of dev experience, dev ops side.


01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.300
And so I was a big Makefile user.


01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:55.820
And when I basically heard, hey, it's like Make


01:03:55.820 --> 01:03:57.780
but more powerful and in Python,


01:03:57.780 --> 01:03:59.900
I immediately went and tried it out.


01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:01.700
And I think spent like the next three days


01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:04.420
just completely rewriting our Makefile in Knox.


01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:05.260
It has been great.


01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:06.740
This has been, it has been so empowering


01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:08.020
for the other developers.


01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:09.700
Whereas before Makefile was pretty archaic


01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.340
and it was pretty much only myself that would touch it.


01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:15.740
Now the other developers feel very comfortable


01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:18.620
jumping into Knox and also being cross-platform.


01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:20.780
I develop on Windows and literally everyone else


01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:22.780
at the company develops on Macs.


01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:25.020
So it gives us a much more cross-platform way


01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:28.380
to handle scripting and building and things like that.


01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:30.540
- Yeah, make files are quite different


01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:32.380
over on the Windows side.


01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:34.540
- Yes, yes, I learned this the hard way.


01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:37.140
It was very often there was like,


01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:40.900
it works on my machine type of stuff going on there.


01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:43.900
And then finally, just another notable package


01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:44.940
is rich click.


01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:46.820
And that is, people don't know,


01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:50.100
Rich is a package in Python that makes text output,


01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:52.180
like terminal output look very, very nice.


01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.260
And that is a nice wrapper on click


01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:57.420
that makes click look very, very, very nice


01:04:57.420 --> 01:04:58.420
because it's wrapped in Rich.


01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:01.300
So our CLI uses this.


01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.540
I think it looks great because of it.


01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:05.140
I'm sorry, I'd also highly recommend that.


01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:09.020
If you're into looking for a more modern feeling CLI


01:05:09.020 --> 01:05:11.940
with a lot of flexibility and format ability.


01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:16.380
- So it gives you kind of automated colorized help text


01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:19.820
and usage text and like option.


01:05:19.820 --> 01:05:21.900
- Yeah, and you can customize that.


01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:24.300
A really, really powerful thing also is that


01:05:24.300 --> 01:05:28.180
it will understand markdown in your doc strings, right?


01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:31.380
So if you want to get a little more fancy,


01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:34.460
it also has kind of its own language that you can use.


01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:37.020
So yeah, it's been really nice


01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:38.380
'cause I was feeling a little bit jealous.


01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:40.420
Our UI looks really nice and our CLI didn't.


01:05:40.420 --> 01:05:42.260
And so I went and wanted to find something


01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:43.660
that would make the CLI look a little bit nicer


01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:44.660
for probably engineers.


01:05:44.660 --> 01:05:47.660
It seems like, ah, that's kind of superficial.


01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:51.100
Like who cares color for your silly CLI?


01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:52.100
It makes a big difference.


01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.140
Like the information bandwidth is so much higher.


01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:56.780
It's high, yeah.


01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.820
- Yeah, it really does make a huge difference.


01:05:58.820 --> 01:05:59.660
- Awesome.


01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:02.140
Well, I think we're gonna leave it here with this,


01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:03.860
but Thomas, thanks for being on the show.


01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:05.420
It's been really great to have you here


01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:07.500
and a lot of fun to talk privacy.


01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:08.820
Yeah, good luck with the project.


01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:09.640
It looks great.


01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:10.900
- Thank you, talk to you later.


01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:12.020
- Yeah, see you later.


01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:16.540
This has been another episode of Talk Python to Me.


01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:17.980
Thank you to our sponsors.


01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:19.340
