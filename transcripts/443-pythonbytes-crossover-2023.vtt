This episode is a special crossover from my Python Bytes podcast that I co-host with Brian Okken.


00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:11.080
It's got a different vibe than the interview shows here and short topics coming in fast and quick.


00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.440
If you haven't listened before, I think you're going to enjoy it.


00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.640
So here are a bunch of excellent Python tips and tools to close out the year.


00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.000
See you all in the first week of January.


00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.560
And while I'm talking directly to you, thank you very, very much for taking the time to listen to my shows and support all of my projects.


00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.340
Cheers.


00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.100
This is Talk Python to Me, sort of.
