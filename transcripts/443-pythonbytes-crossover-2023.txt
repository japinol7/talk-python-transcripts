00:00:00 This episode is a special crossover from my Python Bytes podcast that I co-host with Brian Okken.

00:00:04 It's got a different vibe than the interview shows here and short topics coming in fast and quick.

00:00:11 If you haven't listened before, I think you're going to enjoy it.

00:00:13 So here are a bunch of excellent Python tips and tools to close out the year.

00:00:18 See you all in the first week of January.

00:00:21 And while I'm talking directly to you, thank you very, very much for taking the time to listen to my shows and support all of my projects.

00:00:28 Cheers.
