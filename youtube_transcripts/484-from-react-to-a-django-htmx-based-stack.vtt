00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:01.620
Hey, Sheena.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.920
Hey, how's it going?

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.380
Hey, it's going really well.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.780
Looking forward to doing a show together.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.320
Thanks for everyone who's here on the live stream

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.240
and watching that later.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.600
And with that, Sheena, welcome to Talk Bythonomy.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.540
Yeah, thanks so much.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.300
Happy to be here.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.560
Yeah, I'm happy to have you here.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.460
We've got an awesome topic queued up,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.260
one that I just, I don't know if I'll ever get tired

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.060
of coming back to this

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.460
because I'm just such a fan of simplicity

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.660
and getting stuff done and not like,

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.720
let's see how many layers of things we can pile on.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.320
And by that, I mean, HTMX as a success story

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.000
for going from a whole bunch of front end stuff,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.820
a bunch of different multi, multiple apps,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.820
you know, JavaScript front end,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.020
Django back end talking to each other,

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.080
but kind of being separate as well.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.060
And just switching to HTMX.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.780
And you wrote up a really cool essay on this

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.920
that we're going to dive into.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.880
So, and share your experience.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.560
Yeah, it was a pretty fantastic experience overall.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.920
I was really surprised by HTMX

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.260
when I came across it the first time

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.200
because there are so many fashionable front end

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.220
libraries and frameworks.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.520
So when I heard about it,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.160
I was like, oh, it's another one of those, whatever.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.880
And then I went to a Django con, I think it was 2022.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.760
And I saw a talk from Chris May, who's in the audience.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.260
And that's got me excited about it.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.500
And yeah, that's kind of when my whole story started.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.680
So, yeah.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.800
So what I had been doing before was working with,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.060
so I had this team and we were building a thing

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.300
and we had a React front end.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.960
So on the front, and that's a normal thing.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.360
Like if you wanted a, like a modern front end application,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.960
you'd use something like React or Vue

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.660
or one of the many competitors.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.780
And then on the back end, we had Django.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.940
And I think that's like a fairly normal,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.640
fairly accepted way to do things

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.280
or it has been for a long time.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.560
But I think it's like, I think it's a little faulty.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.300
I think that front end web development

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.460
has been in a little bit of a complexity death spiral

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.580
for the last little while.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.160
And like sometimes it's useful,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.440
sometimes it's really helpful,

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.720
but like for some things you need certain tools

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.800
in the front end, I think.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.120
But yeah, I think it's,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.900
things have been going in the complexity

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.600
for a direction for a long time

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.860
and HTML solves a lot of problems.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.940
All right, well, you think back,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.600
you know, think back to the jQuery days.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.300
How did you use jQuery?

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.020
You included a CDN or if you're wild,

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.560
you might download it and include it

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.720
in your own static content.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.960
And then you just started using it, right?

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.300
And just layers and layers

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.220
have just been building

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.480
and JavaScript of 2024 era

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.000
looks nothing like 10 years ago,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.120
15 years ago, JavaScript.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.620
Yeah.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.480
I would say it's one of the more complicated

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.860
programming environments,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.660
you know, compared to something like C++, right?

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.140
Because there's so many steps in there,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.380
so many implicit linkings and stuff.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.840
Yeah, there's a lot of dark magic under the hood.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.420
It's very hard to know what's going on.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.140
And I think, like, one of the challenges

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.840
is that a lot of people used to get into web dev

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.460
as their gateway drug to programming.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:30.920
Like, they'd start off with web dev

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.080
and then branch out from there.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.660
But now web dev is like this magic,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.780
weird box with so many layers.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.780
And I think it's sort of messed a lot of people up.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.260
It's a challenge to get started

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.720
in the way that people used to get started.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.000
And it's like the barrier to, I don't know,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.820
entry-level programmers used to need to be here

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.900
and now it's here.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.460
And it does a lot of tricky things

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.720
to the ecosystem as a whole.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.040
But yeah, like, all the build steps,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.100
all the magic things that happen under the hood

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.380
and the fact that you have to, like,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.820
tasks switch between completely different applications

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.100
and completely different, like, ways of thinking.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.800
Like, so for me, I've always loved Django.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.520
It's so good.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.620
So with the thing that I was building,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.500
I went to Django because I needed to build a thing

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.680
really, really fast.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.680
And so my efficiency was important.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.640
And then it was like, I need a good front end.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.720
And React was a clear choice at the time.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.080
But it means, like, switching, like,

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.140
for me to work on this thing,

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.060
I need to keep holding the Django application

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.720
and the React application in my head

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.500
and how they talk.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.480
And it's not just React.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.920
It's like Redux and Saga and Side Effects

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.100
and asynchronous goodies.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.880
And then on the Django side, it's all of that.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.100
And Django is, I think, much simpler

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.400
to get your head around than React, actually.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.540
Yeah.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.540
Yeah, it's a tricky thing.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.960
Yeah, it definitely is a tricky thing.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.040
And one thing I would just like to put out early

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.280
before we get too much mail is,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.360
this is not necessarily a hate on JavaScript sort of thing.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.800
There are people in the Node space

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.880
that are super fans of HTMX.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.600
And I think what is not obvious

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.680
about the benefits of HTMX,

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.600
as we get into it,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.980
we'll talk about some of these things.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.160
But you were just touching on that,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.060
like you've got this React front end.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.320
It has its own state.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.620
It also has its own capability.

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.920
So it's running on the client side,

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.900
so it can't talk to file systems or the database.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.460
It can only talk to APIs.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.900
On the other hand, you've got the Django app,

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.580
which probably is not talking to APIs,

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.480
but talks to the database,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.200
talks to the server levels things.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.660
And you've got to,

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.980
as you're working on this app,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.420
think, okay, I'm in this context.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.440
That means no database.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.260
I'm in this context.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.540
That means primarily just database, right?

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:50.160
And it's just,

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.780
you have these two worlds.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.300
And if you could say,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.900
could I just write in one of them?

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.740
And the JavaScript people might even pick,

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.140
like, I just want to stay in JavaScript,

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.180
but always Node.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.920
Or always at least,

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.160
you'll pick one of the styles of programming

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.820
and not just constantly switch back and forth

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.440
between these.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.100
You have browser capabilities.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.160
You have server capabilities.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.240
You have browser information.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.740
Like, just,

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.740
that is just not productive.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.880
It's not the best, right?

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.300
And so as much as you can avoid that,

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.980
and as we'll see,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.400
HTMX is super easy about keeping it in one place, right?

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.900
So that's,

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.020
I think that's one of the big things

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.620
that people should be honing in on

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.380
as we talk about this.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.800
What do you think?

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.420
Oh, yeah, definitely.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.380
Yeah, if I came across as hating on JavaScript,

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.780
I dig JavaScript,

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.440
and I use it a lot where it's needed.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.060
I think it is a fantastic tool in the toolbox

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.200
that I'm on sides with you,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.540
that it's just the complexity

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.360
of switching contexts all the time.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.180
It slows you down,

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.380
and it's a lot to keep in your head.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.400
And so it's like,

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:54.940
for me,

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.260
when I was working on this application

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.080
and needing to switch contexts all the time,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.680
it's like,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.820
like,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.140
you can't just make a thing.

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.540
Like,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.120
you have to,

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.360
like,

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.780
do the dance to make the thing.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.520
it's like...

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.820
Instead of four different

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.600
chained file watchers

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.220
to do their things and stuff, right?

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.680
And so it just,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.860
like,

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:14.100
adds a little bit of a,

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.600
like,

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.980
you're slower than you would like to be.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.320
There's,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.460
like,

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:18.940
more tedium than there should be.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:19.960
It would be nice

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.400
if you could just,

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.680
like,

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.820
build the thing quickly

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.720
in a simple way,

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.480
and it just works

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.100
and it's beautiful.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.340
And HTMX kind of allows that

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.040
along with other tools.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.360
Yeah.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:30.820
So for me,

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:31.520
that context switching

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:31.720
was,

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:31.940
like,

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:32.540
a painful,

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.500
painful thing.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.600
And for the team

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.700
I was working with as well,

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:35.940
like,

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:36.840
I had a bunch of juniors

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.480
on my team

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.820
and it was so hard

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.600
to get them productive

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.900
because it was like,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:41.160
okay,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.000
do you want to be productive

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.640
on the back end

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.460
or do you want to be productive

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.280
on the front end?

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.960
And then on the front end,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:46.280
like,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.140
that was complicated

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.200
because of the,

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.540
again,

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:49.020
React,

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.620
Redux,

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.480
Redux saga.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.180
So they were all

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:52.380
just,

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:52.760
like,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.540
suffering.

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:57.120
And to put real features

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.720
into place,

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.840
you've got to do

00:07:58.840 --> 00:07:59.620
a vertical slice,

00:07:59.620 --> 00:07:59.820
right,

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:00.760
which hits most,

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.580
if not all.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:01.880
You know,

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.760
you probably have to touch

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.740
the React front end.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:05.740
Yeah.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.480
You probably need

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.380
some new tiny bits

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.100
of UI design,

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:10.760
so CSS

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.980
and maybe some

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.220
SaaS build step there

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:14.480
and,

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:14.880
you know,

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:15.260
like,

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:15.920
then you're doing

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.760
the server side bits

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.360
and then you're doing

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.400
a database migration

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:19.960
and it's just,

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.240
like,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:20.900
it's end to end,

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:21.120
right?

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.160
Yeah.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.160
And for some people,

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.560
it's not even reasonable

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.260
to expect them

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.640
to have all of those skills,

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.740
those end to end skills.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.680
And then it's like,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.040
you have to make

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.900
your team complicated.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.440
You have to have

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.080
a back end team

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.940
and a front end team

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.920
and they need to

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.640
now integrate

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:35.420
with each other.

00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:36.020
And so,

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:36.800
like,

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:37.360
the team

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.300
resembles the team stack.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.240
Yeah.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.120
Yeah,

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.760
that's interesting.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:43.060
Yeah,

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:44.240
we have a group

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.720
for this later,

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.300
a group for that later.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:45.480
And,

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.000
you know,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.200
look,

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.120
if you're a huge company,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.940
maybe that actually

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.820
makes tons of sense.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:49.400
Maybe.

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.700
I'm not saying it does,

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.220
but it may.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.020
But when you're a small company,

00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.500
it just doesn't,

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:54.760
right?

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:55.480
No,

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:55.960
no.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.040
And,

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:57.780
yeah,

00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.420
like,

00:08:58.420 --> 00:08:59.960
I think when you're

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.740
building something,

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:01.600
you do need to think

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.240
about the team

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.220
that's going to be building it.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.520
Their skills right now,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.340
the skills that they're

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:06.400
going to have in the future,

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.260
the skills that you're

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:07.940
going to need to pull

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:08.560
into the team

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.100
in the future.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.700
and so it's,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.560
I don't know

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.260
if it makes sense

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:13.700
to,

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.900
well,

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.540
in my context,

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.320
it didn't make sense

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.760
to split up the team.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.640
If I had the tools

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.460
to allow everybody

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.700
to be in the same place

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.580
from the beginning,

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.320
that would have been

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.240
freaking fantastic.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.200
Yeah.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.120
Yeah,

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.520
absolutely.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.200
That would be awesome.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.640
So let's talk about,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.180
let's talk a bit

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.400
about HTMX.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:36.720
So we,

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.520
we said,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:37.720
hey,

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.260
we've been talking

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:38.640
about this

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.300
in sort of broad terms,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:42.480
but let's be a little

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.060
bit specific

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:43.900
and maybe you could

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:44.500
tell us,

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.200
what is this HTMX

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.260
and why is it,

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.140
why is it not just

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.880
a different flavor

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.980
of React or Vue

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:53.420
or something?

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:54.520
And then maybe we could

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.480
talk through a few examples.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.620
Okay,

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:56.920
cool.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.520
So the way I explain

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.880
HTMX to myself

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.960
is that,

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.980
like,

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.540
imagine looking at HTML.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:06.840
HTML is with us.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.660
It's going to be

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:08.360
with us forever.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.220
Maybe not forever,

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:11.700
but for a very long time.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:11.960
What,

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.640
what if we,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.260
there have been many,

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.380
there have been many attempts

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.060
to replace it

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:15.980
and they were all bad.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.480
Yeah.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:18.300
Yeah.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.220
So it's probably going

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:19.740
to stick around

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.780
for the foreseeable future

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:21.440
and it's everywhere.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.240
And what if we could

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.660
just augment it slightly

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.600
so that it could do

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.220
what we needed it to do

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.440
in the modern web?

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:29.880
Like we,

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:30.960
like since HTML

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.760
got invented,

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.600
like it's quite a simple tool,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.940
but now we need to do

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:35.960
all this extra stuff

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.360
because people expect

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.580
all sorts of,

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:39.320
like,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.420
interactivity

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.440
in the user interfaces.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.180
They expect

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.400
asynchronous workloads

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.480
and things like that.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.000
And what if

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.420
HTML could do that?

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.720
And it can do that.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.460
And it's not actually

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.020
that hard

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.800
to make it do that.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.480
You just need to

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.040
add a few extra attributes.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:57.600
And so what HTML is,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.500
is a really,

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.480
really small

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.180
JavaScript library.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.120
And you just include it

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:04.920
as a script tag

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.640
in your page

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.800
and then it's there

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.500
and it's available

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.500
and it's installed

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.160
just like the old,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.540
the good old days

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.980
of jQuery.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.040
Yeah,

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.880
you could just go back

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.880
and throw it in a CDN

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:16.260
if you wanted,

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:16.740
couldn't you?

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.300
That's right.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.220
I hadn't really thought about it.

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:20.800
And then from there,

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.100
you just have

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.900
these extra attributes

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:23.980
on your HTML tags

00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.820
that do different things.

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.000
So, for example,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.400
like,

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.300
so HTML has a lot

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:30.900
of different stuff,

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.700
but if you were to,

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:31.920
like,

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.460
80, 20 years

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.160
and look at the parts

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.120
that are the most used,

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.540
then basically

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.780
the stuff you'll use

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:40.640
the most are,

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.420
like,

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.880
tying into events,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.140
like,

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.140
click event handlers

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:45.560
or whatnot.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.080
And then

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.800
when you click

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:49.320
on the thing

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:49.680
or whatever,

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.420
it'll send

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.760
a request

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.340
to a backend

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.740
and the backend

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.780
responds

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:56.680
with an HTML fragment.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.720
And then you swap

00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.540
that fragment

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.740
into your page

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:02.340
somewhere.

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.000
So, like,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.460
where,

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.520
so if you were

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.000
to look at

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.020
the HTML documentation,

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.140
the hello world

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:10.720
of HTML

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.440
is a button

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.180
and the button says,

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:15.240
has the attributes

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.600
HX post clicked.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:17.960
So,

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.680
it's saying,

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:18.900
like,

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:19.400
when you click

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:19.940
on the button,

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.060
then send

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:21.800
a post request

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.420
to a URL

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:23.740
that's,

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:23.900
like,

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:24.800
forward slash click.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.000
So,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:25.500
you can decide

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:25.800
where,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.180
like,

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.560
what HTTP method

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.160
you're using

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.960
and where it's going

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:30.940
and what event

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.060
you're tying into.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.500
and then when the response

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.200
arrives,

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.260
then you do something

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:36.600
with it.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.160
And the response

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:37.760
is HTML.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.160
It's not a JSON response

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:40.820
that you then need

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.720
to, like,

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.840
turn into HTML.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.840
It's plain old

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.060
normal HTML.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:46.380
So,

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:46.920
it's super simple

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:47.420
to write.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.180
And then you

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.720
take that HTML

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:50.460
and you put it

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.260
somewhere on the page.

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:51.580
So,

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.140
maybe you swap

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.700
the current button

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.360
that you just clicked

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.560
with the HTML

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.220
that was returned.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.340
or maybe you take it

00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.120
and you put it,

00:12:59.120 --> 00:12:59.380
like,

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:00.080
at the end

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.720
of another element.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.200
You can append stuff.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.480
You can pre-pen stuff.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.560
You can replace

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.360
entire elements.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.020
You can replace

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.160
the internals of elements.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.880
And that little pattern

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.580
is actually

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.300
really,

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:13.060
really powerful.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.360
So,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.660
and you can tie

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:17.220
into all sorts

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:17.900
of different events.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:18.180
So,

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:18.720
there's, like,

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.520
interacting

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.560
with individual elements,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.100
like a click

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.100
or a form submission.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.340
You can say,

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:23.520
like,

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:24.100
onload

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.540
or, like,

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.140
onscroll

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.320
or all sorts

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:26.920
of different things.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:27.200
So,

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:28.580
events.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.160
Yeah.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.440
Yeah,

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:29.880
absolutely.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:30.300
So,

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.940
one of the motivations

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.900
that Carl,

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.960
Carson Gross

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.100
puts there

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:35.360
is,

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.120
why should

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.160
A and form

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:37.800
only be able

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:38.920
to make HTTP requests?

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.660
Why should you

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.500
only be able

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.120
to click

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.200
and have click

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.340
and submit events

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:44.880
trigger them,

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.160
right?

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.020
And all these things,

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:46.300
you know?

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:46.520
So,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.540
it's kind of,

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:48.740
like,

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:49.460
just extending

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:50.920
some of these

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.840
niche features.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.460
Like,

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.300
you can click a button

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.560
but not an image

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.200
in HTML

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.220
to,

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.340
to all the pieces.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:59.620
And then,

00:13:59.620 --> 00:13:59.980
like you said,

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.220
exchanging fragments

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:01.860
of HTML,

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:02.500
right?

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:02.780
Like,

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:03.760
just instead

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.720
of sending JSON

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.460
back and then

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.400
having the client

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:06.860
side turn

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:07.400
to end HTML,

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:08.660
just do it

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.060
on the server

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:09.780
and stick it

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:10.220
where it goes,

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:10.460
right?

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.160
Basically,

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:11.600
that's it.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.660
Yeah.

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:12.980
So,

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.700
it's dead simple

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:15.460
to code as well,

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:16.940
which is fantastic.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:17.240
So,

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:17.800
it's a simple,

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.340
but you're just

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:21.280
server-side rendering

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:21.960
some HTML

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.080
HTML,

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:24.240
like we used

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.020
to a long time

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:25.260
ago.

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:25.480
So,

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.720
it feels very

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.480
familiar to people

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.000
who got into

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:28.580
webdev a long

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.120
time ago.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.660
And the code

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:32.500
itself is very,

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:33.420
very easy to write.

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:33.780
Like,

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:34.400
initially,

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:34.800
you might,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:34.980
like,

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:35.620
scratch your head,

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.120
it's unfamiliar,

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.480
but give yourself

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.600
a couple of hours

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.500
and it'll start

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.100
to feel familiar.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.680
It's,

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.400
yeah,

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:43.820
it's lovely

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:44.400
to work in.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.000
Yeah,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:46.900
I would also

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:47.620
encourage people

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.260
that want to get

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:48.940
started with this

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.660
and play with this.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.340
The examples

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.340
that they have

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:52.820
on the website

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:53.560
are pretty

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.100
comprehensive,

00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:54.400
right?

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:54.760
If you scroll

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:54.940
through,

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:55.300
I don't know

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:55.700
how many there

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:55.840
are,

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.720
maybe 20 or so.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.820
Yeah,

00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.480
more than that.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.000
It's a lot.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:00.200
Yeah,

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:00.480
perhaps,

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:00.780
yeah,

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:01.200
there's a lot

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:01.660
of them here.

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:02.320
And then,

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:02.760
so,

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:03.300
if you go into

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:04.000
each one of them,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.600
it'll show you

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.000
basically some

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.600
interesting things.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:07.820
So,

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:08.780
if you go to

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.260
the first one

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:09.920
and click to edit,

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.280
it says,

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.200
here's a bit

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.080
of static HTML,

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.880
like a label

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:14.600
and a div

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.820
and then a button

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:16.280
that says,

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:16.920
click to edit.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.180
And all it has

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.580
is HX get

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:20.580
and it says,

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:21.400
edit this thing,

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:21.620
right?

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.380
And,

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.160
when you go

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:25.800
and click it,

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.460
like,

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:27.000
there's a little

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.660
example at the bottom.

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:28.320
You click it,

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.300
that's all fun.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.980
But,

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:31.920
if you open up

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.360
the bottom,

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:33.780
there's like a little

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.480
history of interactions

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.360
and,

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:37.800
like,

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.220
I don't know

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:39.820
what you call it,

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:40.020
but,

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:42.360
like a web history

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.020
that shows

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:43.820
what's transferred.

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:44.140
so,

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.320
when you clicked edit,

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.060
here's what the response was

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:47.580
and it shows

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:48.680
the HTML fragment,

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:49.840
which then itself

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.600
is a new,

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.340
has HX events

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:55.400
and then when it saves it,

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:55.920
it goes back

00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:56.520
to the static

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.240
and so on.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:57.820
And I think

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.300
it's a really

00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.400
pretty easy way

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.800
to get a sense

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.360
of what it is.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:01.920
What do you think?

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:02.480
Yeah,

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:02.660
yeah.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:03.320
Yeah,

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:03.780
I think so.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:04.260
I think so.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:04.840
Those examples

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:05.340
are great.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:06.900
I think,

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:07.100
like,

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:07.720
one thing

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.860
that I like

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:09.880
to do

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.140
is use HTMX

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:11.640
and a thing

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.560
called Alpine JS

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.040
together.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.780
So,

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:17.120
yeah,

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:17.420
so,

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:18.300
so for me,

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.540
HTMX is great

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.560
for when the data

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.300
needs to be passed

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:21.840
back and forth,

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.040
but,

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:22.220
like,

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.000
for something like this,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:23.760
I'd probably use

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.620
something like Alpine

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:25.100
just to say,

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:25.460
like,

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.700
show and hide,

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:27.740
hide the form.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.300
Yeah,

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.380
it's also fantastic.

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:30.860
So,

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.420
you don't,

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:32.740
like,

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.740
strictly need it,

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:34.300
I suppose,

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.160
but it does save

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.480
on,

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:36.980
like,

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:37.840
some back and forth

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.520
and it does make

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.140
things a little bit

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:39.680
more,

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.520
like,

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.200
in one place,

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.200
a little bit more,

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.120
like,

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.200
locality of behaviors

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.240
are useful.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:46.620
Yeah.

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.280
So,

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:48.780
now we're looking

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.100
at Alpine JS

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:50.800
in the world

00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.780
and this is cool

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.360
because it also,

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.700
it's like HTMX

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:55.480
in that it just adds

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.260
a couple of extra

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.700
attributes to your

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:58.660
HTML tags

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.080
and the 80-20

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.240
of this is that

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.860
you can define

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:04.580
variables

00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:05.720
and those variables

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.560
are,

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:06.880
like,

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:07.240
this,

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.160
like a state

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.940
and they are

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.100
defined within the scope

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:13.920
of the place

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.600
where you defined it.

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:14.760
So,

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.400
if you have,

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:15.560
like,

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.380
div x data

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.040
equals

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.360
open false

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:19.380
as a JSON object

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.560
inside within the scope

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.140
of this div

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.100
we have this thing

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:22.660
called open

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.620
and its initial value

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:24.080
is false

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.580
and then you can

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:27.600
do things like

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.500
click on a button

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.600
to change open

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.000
to true

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.620
or to toggle

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.200
open.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:32.460
So,

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:32.840
you can have it,

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:33.060
like,

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:33.720
show form

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:34.400
true or false

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:36.400
and then you can say,

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.100
then you can,

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:37.260
like,

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:37.480
say,

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:37.920
you know,

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.620
it says span

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.000
extra equals open.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.220
So,

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.080
we only show that

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.920
under certain circumstances

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:43.760
and you can also have,

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:43.980
like,

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.800
not open

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.560
or you can have,

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:46.820
like,

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:47.600
it speaks JavaScript

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.540
so you can do

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.720
some interesting things

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.400
in there as well.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.600
Yeah,

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.520
this is pretty interesting.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:53.900
This is,

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:54.140
yeah,

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:54.460
this is something

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.800
I have not really used

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.900
but I do hear

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.700
Alpine and HTMX

00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.780
mentioned together frequently.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:00.920
They do have a similar vibe.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.920
Yeah,

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.140
yeah,

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:02.500
they do.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.040
They do.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:05.280
Yeah,

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.340
I've enjoyed it a lot.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:07.420
I tend to just use it

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:07.760
for, like,

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:07.980
small,

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:08.620
simple things

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.920
but those small,

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:10.920
simple things add up.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.840
So,

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.300
for example,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.720
if you have menus

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.600
that open and close

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.740
and things like that,

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.160
you might,

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:16.940
you might want to use

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:17.720
something like this.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.620
Yeah,

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.780
or

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.420
event handling,

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:24.020
like,

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.540
if you click this button

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:26.580
and change the state to this

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.240
and then it triggers

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.380
the binding

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.800
to open and close sections

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:30.320
and so on,

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:30.440
yeah?

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:30.860
Yeah,

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:31.080
yeah,

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:31.560
yeah.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.080
Okay.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.680
Interesting.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.400
Yeah,

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:34.920
you know,

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.120
one example

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.480
that I can give

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.420
from over

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.120
that stuff

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:39.620
that I'm working on

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.160
is I'm definitely

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:40.860
using HTMX

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.580
over at Talk Python

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:41.980
training,

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.240
right,

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:42.720
for our courses

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.580
and I added this

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.240
little

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.460
tag cloud

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.300
is not quite a cloud

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:48.960
but a bunch of different

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.880
things you can explore.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.580
So,

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:51.560
when you load this page,

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:51.920
actually,

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.180
one of the things

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.000
that's really challenging

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.280
is it has the price

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.400
in your local currency

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.200
so it figures out

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:58.740
where is your IP,

00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.300
where do you live

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.640
and that currency,

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.640
the prices of those things,

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.080
you know,

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.080
outside of the US

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.120
change a lot

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:05.780
and it's super,

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:06.800
sometimes it can be

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.520
really slow

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:08.560
to figure out

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.060
what the price

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:09.940
of every course is

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:10.660
if there's sales

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:11.640
and you're in this country

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.240
and that applies

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:12.760
in this way.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.500
So,

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.480
all these little

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.420
prices are all

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:16.520
calculated with

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.440
HTMX.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:17.620
So,

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.760
it loads normally

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.480
without the prices

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.180
then probably

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:20.660
by the time

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:21.360
you get to it

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.140
the prices are already

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:23.540
there automatically

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.100
and then

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.700
as you click around

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:26.580
you get,

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.420
this is all,

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:27.720
like,

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.240
as you click

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:28.860
these little tags

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:29.240
up here,

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.440
you can even click

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.380
on the HTMX tag

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:31.900
and see you have

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:33.540
three HTMX courses,

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:33.960
right,

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.720
with Flask,

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.020
Django,

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:35.700
and one that just

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.440
kind of uses it.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.760
But all of this stuff,

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.300
there's no JavaScript

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.020
on this page,

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.300
at least not doing

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:41.700
any of it.

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:42.260
It's all just

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:42.920
HTMX,

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.120
right?

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.520
Yeah,

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.020
that's great.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:45.900
Beautifully good.

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:46.560
It's so good.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:46.820
So,

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.180
yeah,

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:49.620
I've certainly

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.720
enjoyed working

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.000
with it.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.780
But,

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.380
you know,

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.700
let's talk a bit

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:54.880
about your

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.200
right of,

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:55.300
like,

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:56.220
let's talk about,

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:56.640
you know,

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.140
spend the rest of

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:57.540
the time on

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.920
your story,

00:19:58.920 --> 00:19:59.600
how you started

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:00.580
using HTMX.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:00.760
I mean,

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.440
you've given us

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.900
some of the senses,

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.280
but let's talk

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.320
about the app

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:05.780
that you were

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:06.160
building,

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:06.900
right?

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:07.620
You had this team

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.300
of fairly junior

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:10.040
developers.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.960
What's the story?

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.820
At the time,

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.300
I was working

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.980
for a nonprofit

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:17.000
training provider

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:17.860
in South Africa,

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.900
and we used

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:21.160
to have everybody

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:21.800
on premises

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.740
in this place

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:23.560
called Jeffy's Town,

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.280
which is really

00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.260
a dodgy place.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.400
And it was great.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.240
It was a lot

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:27.580
of fun.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:28.920
But then COVID

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:29.300
happened,

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:30.120
and so we had

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:30.660
to figure out

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.380
how to support

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:32.240
everybody remotely.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.340
And so,

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.160
it built an LMS.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.020
So,

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:36.680
initially,

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.240
we, like,

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:37.840
looked around

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.180
that LMS means

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:39.780
learner management

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.200
system.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.600
We had a whole

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.120
lot of learners.

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:42.480
We had,

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.520
I think there were

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.880
about 150 at the time,

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.120
and we needed

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:46.880
to figure out,

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.300
like,

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:48.320
how to support

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:48.880
them from home.

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:49.400
We couldn't just

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:49.680
be like,

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.480
come back next year

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.300
because the,

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.260
like,

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.460
partially we couldn't

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.240
let them down,

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.040
partially the funding

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:55.960
model wouldn't work

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.860
and all sorts of things.

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.080
Yeah,

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.560
it was an insane time.

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:00.220
It's kind of

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.140
normalized in our

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:01.740
history because

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:02.860
we've moved past it,

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:04.460
but we've got to

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:04.720
remember,

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.180
that was a disturbing

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:06.620
time.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.520
Yeah,

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:07.920
yeah.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:08.360
Like,

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:08.900
so many people

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.180
have horror stories

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.140
from then.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.360
I was like,

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:13.140
this was hard.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:13.360
It was,

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:13.540
like,

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:13.920
super,

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.540
super stressful.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.960
But in the end,

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.500
we ended up

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:18.300
with this cool thing.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.420
So,

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.720
yeah,

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.020
so,

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:21.320
like,

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.980
a lot of LMSs

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:23.260
exist.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:23.840
You can get one

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.340
off the shelf,

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:24.960
and they're

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:25.560
a lot like

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.720
very clever textbooks

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.880
that track learners

00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.640
over time.

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.080
But for us,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.080
we're training,

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:31.880
we're training software

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.280
developers.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.220
And so,

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.720
we wanted something

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:35.540
more than a textbook.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:36.160
We wanted to train

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:36.640
professionals.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.020
And so,

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:37.740
we ended up building

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.340
this thing.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.000
From the learner's

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.400
perspective,

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.800
it was a Kanban board.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.280
And then,

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.280
they could move cards

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:45.980
around on the board

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:46.840
to do different things.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:47.180
They could,

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:47.420
like,

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.240
start a project

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:48.760
and then we'd

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.280
create a repo

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.120
for them

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.040
and make,

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.880
add them as a collaborator

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:53.880
and protect the main

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.800
branch and all of that

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.280
good stuff.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:55.580
And then,

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.240
we could get them

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.140
to review each other

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:57.700
and we could track

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.420
all that and display

00:21:58.420 --> 00:21:59.180
it in the front end.

00:21:59.180 --> 00:21:59.400
Right.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.440
Try to teach them

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.460
Git and GitHub

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.640
and PRs

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.020
and all that.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:03.400
Yeah.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:03.980
Yeah,

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:04.600
it was so cool.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:04.880
Like,

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.720
by the time they got

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.620
to work,

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:07.500
like,

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:07.860
they were always

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.460
very nervous

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.120
getting into their

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:09.620
first job

00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:10.320
and then they'd say,

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:10.560
like,

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.220
this is familiar.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.020
Like,

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.000
we know how this works.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.640
I'm teaching people

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.220
stuff here,

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:15.520
actually.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:15.960
That's weird.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.360
Yeah,

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.120
it was great.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:19.520
Yeah,

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:19.720
it was cool.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.020
Yeah,

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.000
so built this thing out

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.220
and managed to keep

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:25.160
training the people

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:25.860
and it worked

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.820
and then it was like,

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.060
okay,

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:28.760
this thing is pretty

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.660
rough around the edges

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.700
because we built it

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.020
in self-defense

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:32.880
and,

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.620
like,

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:34.420
we're like,

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:34.700
hey,

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:34.900
shit,

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:35.780
I hope this works.

00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:38.180
So,

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.220
we needed to

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.160
build more on it

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.920
and we were hiring

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.500
a lot of junior developers

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.220
because we were training,

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:45.600
like,

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.140
very,

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.680
very beginner stuff

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.400
and,

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:48.640
so,

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.660
if you want to teach

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.560
a person what a return

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.240
statement is

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.060
or what a loop is

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:52.820
or anything like that,

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:53.780
then you don't need

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:54.580
a senior developer

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:54.940
or,

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:55.100
like,

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:55.840
a senior lecturer.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.520
You need somebody

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:57.280
who understands

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.260
what a loop is

00:22:58.260 --> 00:22:59.540
and what a return

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:00.080
statement is.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:00.220
So,

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:00.500
we had,

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:00.760
like,

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.060
all these juniors

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:02.740
running around,

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.000
like,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:03.680
helping out

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.560
and they needed

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:06.240
to build stuff

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.200
with their own growth

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:07.660
as well

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:08.380
and their own,

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:10.140
like,

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.220
if they don't build stuff

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:12.160
then they're built

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:13.140
and it's sad.

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:13.680
So,

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.680
yeah,

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.360
so,

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:16.920
so we're trying

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.580
to get them productive

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.220
on the stack

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.040
but it was

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:19.640
very,

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.220
very difficult.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:20.720
So,

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:21.120
for me,

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:21.840
I'd been working

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.980
on React applications

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:23.660
and I've been working

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:24.180
on Django

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:24.700
and so,

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:25.260
for me,

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:25.780
it was fine.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:26.260
I could just,

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:26.600
like,

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.440
like,

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.060
I could keep

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:29.480
the whole thing

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:29.980
in my head

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.000
but,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.040
yeah,

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:32.460
it was just,

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.060
it was just really

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:33.600
tough for them.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.740
So,

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:36.660
I think there is

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.460
a little bit of an art

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.320
to making a junior

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.280
developer productive

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:39.640
but,

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:39.860
like,

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:40.680
I just was not

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:41.340
figuring it out.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:42.180
So,

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.040
I tried this for a while

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.220
and then one day

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.160
I went to DjangoCon US

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.820
and I saw Chris May's talk

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:49.780
that spoke about

00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:50.480
HTMX

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:50.900
and I was just,

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.100
like,

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.540
maybe this is worth a try.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:54.200
So,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.960
I was,

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:56.100
like,

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:56.360
okay,

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:56.860
I'm just going to

00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:57.760
proof of concept it

00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:58.920
and see if I can build

00:23:58.920 --> 00:23:59.800
the weirdest parts

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:00.580
of our application

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:01.840
in HTMX.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.560
Yeah.

00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.000
That's awesome.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:05.440
Yeah.

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.080
Because,

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:06.780
because you're,

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.420
I guess the question is,

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.980
if you're asking,

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:10.900
will it work,

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.140
you're like,

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.540
this is the most

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.400
crazy interactive bit

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.160
and if it can do this,

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.260
the other stuff is easy.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:16.560
Like,

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.000
switching from logged in

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.940
to log out

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:20.400
or whatever is like,

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:20.540
yeah,

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:20.660
okay,

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.080
that's,

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:21.620
that's nothing,

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:21.960
right?

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.960
Yeah,

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:23.220
yeah,

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:23.820
yeah.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:24.220
So,

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.200
most of our functionality

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.640
was around this

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.480
Kanban board.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:28.700
So,

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:28.940
I was like,

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.240
all right,

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:29.620
let me just,

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.720
make some cards

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:31.520
and make some columns

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:32.820
and see if I can

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:33.700
shift stuff around

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.880
and it all worked out

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:36.540
really well

00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:37.260
and it wasn't,

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.380
it wasn't super hard.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:38.740
Like,

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:39.580
I think one of the,

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.540
one of the challenges

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:41.500
with HTMX

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.500
is that it's very easy

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.720
to build like spaghetti

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:45.360
templates

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.300
because you have

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:48.300
like the main template

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:49.360
and all these partials

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.140
and you need to,

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.900
and then all these URLs

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:52.620
that are pointing

00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:53.340
to the partials.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:53.520
So,

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.400
so it is possible

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.060
to get yourself

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:56.100
in a bit of a tangle there.

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:56.220
So,

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.160
you need to arrange

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:57.780
things nicely.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.600
but yeah,

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.280
the process

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:00.960
was so smooth

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.420
that I was like,

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:02.440
let me try this.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.260
So,

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:05.040
our application

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.280
was this Django app

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:06.840
on the back

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.700
exposing a bunch

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:08.200
of APIs

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.600
with Django REST framework

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.440
and so

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.500
the idea

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:12.280
was to just

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.180
instead of,

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:13.780
like,

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:14.960
we'd leave the React

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.780
app as is

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:16.840
and we'd keep on working.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:17.260
Meanwhile,

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:17.600
we'd,

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.340
we'd just build out

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.140
some like perfectly

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.560
normal Django views

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.120
to do the HTMX stuff

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:22.560
and then we could

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.560
move everybody

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.060
over to the new,

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.240
the new application.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:26.560
So,

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.280
the new front end

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.440
was part of the original

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.580
Django app.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:30.040
So,

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.000
we didn't rebuild

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:31.920
absolutely everything.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.140
We just rebuilt that part

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:36.600
and generally speaking,

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.060
if somebody suggests

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:38.980
rebuilding a thing,

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.300
I worry,

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:41.780
like usually it's a bad idea.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.820
Usually it's like,

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.120
yeah,

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.760
a pull or something.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:48.100
Yes,

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.120
I've had to stop myself

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:49.880
many times.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.540
Do you know that David,

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:53.860
is it David Be,

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:54.480
Be,

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.480
not Beasley,

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.360
Beady,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.120
if you look for,

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.640
there's a great song

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:01.920
that says,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.820
we're going,

00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:05.120
going to do

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.420
the big rewrite

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.520
on YouTube.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:09.260
Let's see.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.120
Yeah,

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:10.640
there we go.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.580
This,

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:15.380
this is so good.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:15.600
So,

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:15.980
if,

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:16.880
I think,

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.340
oh,

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:17.760
it's got,

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:18.940
it's got some ad.

00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:20.720
Dylan Beady it is.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:20.880
Yeah,

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.120
check,

00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.140
I'll put a link in here.

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:22.720
It's got some,

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.900
some amazing parodies

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:25.700
and one's,

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.500
it's a six and a half minute

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:28.620
parody of American Pie.

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.160
We're going to do

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:29.740
the big rewrite

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:30.960
and it's,

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.740
it's glorious.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.040
So,

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:32.900
I'll link it,

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.020
but you should be afraid,

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:35.280
right?

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:36.500
This is something that like,

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.600
we're going to rewrite it

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:38.740
and basically the song is,

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:39.680
here's the eight version,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.660
the eight different languages

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.560
that thing's previously

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.260
been written in,

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:42.940
you know?

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:43.560
Yeah.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.040
It's,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.700
when something's working

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:46.340
sometimes,

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:48.720
even if it's not perfect.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.180
Yeah.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.420
And it was also like,

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.020
rewriting it in order to optimize

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:54.820
for this team

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:56.100
that was mostly juniors.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:56.720
And so I was like,

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.400
is this like,

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.640
is this me being crazy?

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.140
Like,

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.300
there was a lot of,

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:00.740
um,

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:01.940
yeah,

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:02.180
I was,

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.000
I was very unsure.

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:04.300
Um,

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:04.800
but then,

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.160
so I tried everything out

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:07.520
and it,

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:08.200
and it worked

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.060
and it was fun

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:09.880
and it was like,

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.500
like straightforward to write

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.540
for this like small thing.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:13.360
Um,

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.600
and then I was like,

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.520
let me see how the team

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.200
works on this.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:17.860
So I gave them

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:18.720
a bunch of little,

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.520
um,

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:20.540
tasks to do.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:21.020
I was like,

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:22.060
implement this,

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:22.600
try that,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.040
da, da, da.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.240
and everybody

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:24.980
was productive.

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.200
So I felt like,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.100
how did they receive it

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:27.380
when you,

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.040
when you introduced

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.080
this idea to them

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.520
after they'd been living

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.880
in react and

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.980
redux and all these things?

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:35.700
I think for them,

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.020
they were happy with it.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:38.600
I think at first

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.360
a little bit skeptical,

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.520
but then once they

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:41.560
started going,

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.300
like I,

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.940
I did get feedback

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:45.520
from them.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.100
I make a point

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:46.740
of getting feedback

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.160
from them

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:47.900
and they were like,

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:48.800
this HTMX thing

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.380
is way better.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:51.700
So that's nice.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:52.500
Wait,

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:53.280
what's the trick?

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.120
Why does this work?

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.220
Yeah.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:55.680
Yeah.

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.480
Um,

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.400
so they went with it,

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:57.780
um,

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:58.100
but,

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.200
and then they succeeded

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.900
and they were happy

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:02.420
and productive,

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.080
which is great.

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:03.360
And like,

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.300
even people who needed

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.480
like way too much

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.180
of my support,

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:06.920
like people who I had

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:07.760
to like really sit

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.740
with and pair with

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.720
like just to do

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.560
like anything,

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.680
they were suddenly

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.580
able to do stuff

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:13.260
that was meaningful.

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:15.260
So I think for me,

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:16.180
that's one of the things

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.060
that's so exciting

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.080
about HTMX.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:18.540
It's like,

00:28:18.540 --> 00:28:20.100
I've been working

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:21.380
and training for so long

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.440
and I've been,

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:25.520
like fighting the fight

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.040
of like getting

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:26.860
junior developers

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.420
job ready for so long

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:28.700
that,

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.640
um,

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.780
like I'm,

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.000
I'm aware of many problems

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.460
in the tech education ecosystem

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.960
and the junior hiring ecosystem

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.780
and like the fact

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:38.900
that entry level positions

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.300
are like too hard

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.120
for people,

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.900
like it's a problem.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.160
and now we have tools

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.500
that make web developments

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.520
approachable again.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.280
So like I'm singing

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.300
this HTMX song

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:50.820
because I think

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:51.720
it's going to change

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.600
the industry

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:52.900
in,

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.160
in some pretty big ways.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:54.860
I think it's already

00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:55.580
making waves,

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:56.420
but I'd like them

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.980
to happen faster

00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:58.360
and bigger.

00:28:59.280 --> 00:28:59.460
Yeah.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.800
I think it will as well

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.520
and,

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.260
you know,

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.240
I think the current

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:07.760
web frameworks

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.740
are really good

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.680
and work really well

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:09.980
with it,

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:11.400
but I wonder if,

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.260
I wouldn't be surprised

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.840
to see kind of like

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.300
FastAPI came along

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:15.960
and just said,

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.600
Pydantic is the essence

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:18.200
of this thing

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.400
and Pydantic changed

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.460
a lot of data exchange,

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.220
a lot of data validation.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:22.800
I'd wonder if some framework

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:23.360
comes along

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.380
and just says,

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:25.760
HTMX is just

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.300
ground up part

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:28.900
of this thing.

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:29.340
All right.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:29.940
That'd be interesting

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.920
to see what that looks like.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.480
It would be interesting.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.100
I think

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.680
there are definitely

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.860
useful patterns

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:36.600
and how to,

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.700
how to do different things

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.600
and people are building

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.920
tools around it

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.000
or tools that complements

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:42.880
it in useful ways.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.260
So we spoke about Alpine JS.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.080
There's another thing

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.700
called template partials

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.740
from the other Carlton,

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:50.380
Carlton Gibson.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.920
And he,

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.000
and that's really,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.580
really great.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.240
Yeah.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:55.820
Yeah,

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:56.120
absolutely.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:56.580
This is,

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.460
this is something like this

00:29:58.460 --> 00:29:59.460
is super needed

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:01.240
to make the code go from like,

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:01.440
all right,

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.280
we can do this too.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:02.940
Oh,

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:03.580
that's nice.

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:04.040
Yeah.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:04.280
Yeah.

00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:05.340
That's super nice.

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.240
Yeah.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:06.540
Yeah.

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:07.000
Yeah.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.500
This really unspaghetti-fies it,

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.600
which is fantastic.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.540
Like this is one of my favorites

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:12.360
at the moment.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.340
Yeah.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:14.120
This is awesome.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:14.480
Yeah.

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.280
I have one

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:17.820
that I created

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:19.740
for Jinja card,

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:20.080
Jinja,

00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.400
Jinja partials

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.700
and also a chameleon one.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.680
So since I'm,

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.920
I wasn't using

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.960
for that,

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.680
that course example,

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.880
this is actually chameleon.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.160
So I'll use the chameleon partials,

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.400
but you know,

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.020
something like this

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.080
is required in,

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:35.440
you know,

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.100
Carlton does great work,

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:37.300
right?

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:38.280
Yeah.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:38.500
Yeah.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.000
Yeah.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.740
Known for it.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:41.600
So you're using this

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.120
as part of,

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:43.000
as part of your,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.660
your site.

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.000
So not that original site.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.820
I only heard about this later on,

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.620
but now I use it

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.260
on everything.

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:52.100
Yeah.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:54.600
I'm on all of my HTMX things.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.500
I use this.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:56.360
Right.

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.200
Tell the Django people,

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.300
what does this do?

00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:58.680
Like why,

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.860
why do you need Django template partials

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.640
instead of just Django templates?

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.680
So it's just about

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.920
organizing your code

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.160
in a way that's a bit cleaner.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.420
So if you think about

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.760
how you would render templates

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.740
from your different views,

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.280
if you had like a main page

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.900
and then that page

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.300
had a bunch of HTMX things happening

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.220
that made calls to the backend

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.220
to different views

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:22.580
and those different views

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.460
use different templates,

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:25.880
then even though

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.680
all those templates

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.100
are associated with the same page,

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.680
it kind of ends up being

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.380
a bit of a mess.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.020
You've got like a lot of different

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:33.420
like partial templates

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:34.620
so you need a cool

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:35.900
naming convention for that.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.820
Like is this a page?

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:37.540
Is this a template?

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.860
And it gets just a little bit

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.000
a little bit messy.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.960
And you need to switch

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.220
between files all the time

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.040
to see what things

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.420
are associated with each other.

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.040
Let's say you've got

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:52.080
like five pages

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:52.700
and each of them

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.820
have like five different

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.400
partials associated with them.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.080
Suddenly it's a lot of files

00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:58.940
and you need to organize

00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:59.780
things somehow.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:02.040
So what Django template partials

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.240
does is it allows

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.640
you to like,

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.880
like say you've got

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.140
like a main page file

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:09.180
to-do list, right?

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.900
You could define

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.040
a partial template

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.380
for a to-do item

00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.180
within that same file

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:16.320
and it won't get rendered

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:17.080
until you say

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:17.840
render this thing.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.900
So you can like

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.860
when you render

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:21.640
your template

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.520
for the first time,

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.440
you can just say,

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.080
okay,

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:26.180
loop over the to-do items

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.020
and use this partial

00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:27.580
in place

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:28.440
and render the things

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:29.100
and that's great.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.580
But then the other thing

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:31.300
that you can do

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.500
is that you can

00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:35.080
like in a view,

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.780
you can choose

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:38.600
to render a template

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.960
but you can choose

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.180
to render a partial

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.300
within that template

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:42.860
as well.

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.720
And so let's say

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.100
you've got

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.000
like a little form

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:47.460
that says

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.820
add a new to-do list item.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:50.280
then you'd submit

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:50.900
that form

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.980
and then the view

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:54.520
would look

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:55.620
for the partial

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.740
within the page

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.080
that you care about

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:00.040
and it'll render that.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:01.400
And so it just ends up

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.100
being that

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.040
like everything

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.120
is tidy and together

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.000
and it makes sense

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:05.500
because like

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.380
the to-do list items

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.240
are only used

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.200
in this page

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:08.900
and those items

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:09.420
are only used

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:10.060
in that page.

00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:10.580
Yeah, yeah.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.540
Yeah.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.580
One of the big challenges

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.520
that you'll quickly

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.000
run into

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.060
with this style,

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.320
this HTMX

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.760
partial exchange style

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.380
is when you show

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.280
the page originally

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.240
you want just

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.500
the server rendered version

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.300
which includes

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:25.720
let's say

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.780
your to-do items.

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.940
So you need

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:29.460
the HTML

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:30.520
for the to-do items

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:31.260
in the main page

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:31.960
but then when you

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:32.960
make changes to it

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.000
you need a little

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:34.760
fragment of that

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.900
same HTML

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.180
to put a new

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:38.340
to-do item in there

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.080
or to edit one

00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:39.460
or something.

00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:41.600
and if you're not careful

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.560
well then you have

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.580
multiple copies

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.480
of those laying around

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.360
and somebody updates

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:47.580
the design for one

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.520
and then it doesn't

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.100
update the partial one

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:50.580
that you wrote

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:51.380
which is a copy

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.200
it's not pretty.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.240
So finding a way

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:54.980
for reuse

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:55.960
like this Django

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.720
templates partials

00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:58.640
it's pretty required

00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.020
I think

00:33:59.020 --> 00:33:59.820
if you're going

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:00.480
to stay sane.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.100
It's like

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.080
functions are required

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:03.660
to write code

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.000
you know

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:04.920
it's pretty much

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.600
like that right?

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.980
Yeah, yeah.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:09.060
Yeah, I think so.

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:09.580
I think so.

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.460
Like you can get away

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.080
with just using

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.140
like lots of files

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:13.440
and you could

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.380
keep things dry

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.180
with lots of files

00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:15.860
but it gets

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:17.740
like it's very spaghetti

00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:19.220
unless you put

00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:20.060
a lot of effort

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.100
into organizing it

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.360
and then keeping

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:22.900
it organized

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:23.520
because people

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.200
make PRs

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:25.040
do like all sorts

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.020
of weird things.

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.540
So yeah,

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.360
yeah,

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:29.360
it's like

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:29.820
it's not

00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:31.120
it's not good

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.040
to have to

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:33.400
like monitor

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:34.680
that everything's organized

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.260
it would be better

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:35.840
if it was just

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.040
done by default.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.040
Yeah, exactly.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:39.180
So the default behavior

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:39.700
is correct.

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:40.220
Yeah.

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:40.840
Yeah.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.420
So grab a file

00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.900
a library for that.

00:34:43.900 --> 00:34:45.620
All right.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:46.280
So

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.420
let's talk about

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.120
the before

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.700
and after stack.

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:53.440
So before

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.060
you talked about React

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:55.600
but tell us

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:56.540
all the pieces involved

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:56.880
and then

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:58.020
what does it look like

00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:58.380
today?

00:34:58.380 --> 00:34:59.920
Okay, cool.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.860
so React

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:02.320
Redux

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.260
so Redux

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:03.700
was for

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:04.740
just state management

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:05.480
and then

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.140
I used Redux

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:06.400
Saga

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:06.960
for

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.140
mostly for

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.020
data fetching stuff

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:09.560
so that I could

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:10.780
handle like loading

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.400
spinners

00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:12.020
and I could

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.380
see

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.020
like

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.720
the status

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:16.520
of different requests

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.020
over time

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:17.740
and that kind of thing.

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:18.480
Then

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:18.980
I used

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:19.800
material UI

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.620
because

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.020
my

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.180
like front end

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:23.020
make pretty skills

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:23.360
aren't

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.320
the strongest.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.080
so I wanted

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:26.540
a component

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:27.060
library

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:27.380
that would

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:27.840
just work

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:28.240
and

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.340
that was

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:29.700
the

00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:30.840
that was

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.500
the chosen one.

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.320
Then

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.540
on the back end

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.260
it was Django

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:36.160
and Django REST

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:36.480
framework

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.000
is

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.100
is fairly well known.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:38.720
Then

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:39.280
I used a thing

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:40.160
called Django Guardian

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.120
because

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:41.700
I needed

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:42.640
object level

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.060
permissions

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:43.860
on the different

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:44.680
model instances.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:45.140
So

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:46.900
for example

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:47.700
so we had

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.540
this Kanban board

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.180
and there were

00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.160
cards on this board

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:50.760
that's that people

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.460
could move around

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:51.860
and

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:52.940
different people

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:53.340
would have

00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:53.900
different permission

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:54.740
to different cards.

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:55.420
So

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.880
we had things like

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.600
one learner

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.240
would be working

00:35:59.240 --> 00:35:59.720
on a card

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.180
and then they'd

00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:00.980
ask for a review

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:01.780
and then another

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:02.640
learner should be

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:03.600
able to review that

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.760
but we wouldn't

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.920
want to

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.020
let just any

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:08.380
learner

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:09.100
look at their

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:09.460
code

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:09.980
because

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.100
then it would

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:11.620
cause all sorts

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.060
of problems.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:12.540
So it's like

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.300
okay this person

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:13.760
has finished

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:14.280
this project

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:14.700
so we can

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.200
add them

00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.720
as a reviewer

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.460
on this card

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:18.360
and so we

00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:18.940
needed to be

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:19.640
like pretty

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.400
particular

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.320
about like

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.120
which of our

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:22.540
users could

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:22.940
see different

00:36:22.940 --> 00:36:23.260
things.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:23.780
It wasn't

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.580
super straightforward

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.100
in that this

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:26.720
person can

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:27.240
see this.

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.060
It was like

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:28.500
this person

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:28.880
can for

00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:29.520
these reasons.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.480
So Django

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.140
Guardian is

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:33.880
really really

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:34.160
cool.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.700
That's a cool

00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:36.040
library.

00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.280
Maybe people

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.480
could find

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.120
a nice use

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:39.520
for that one.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.500
That's the

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:40.900
one that's

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:41.340
new to me.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.960
That's really

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.580
nice and you

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.140
can even do

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:45.820
things like

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:47.300
when you query

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:47.820
a database

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:48.960
and you say

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.600
fetch me all

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.120
the cards

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:50.740
you can do

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:51.340
something like

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.020
fetch me all

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:52.480
the cards

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.320
that Bob

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:53.740
can see.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:55.060
And so long

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:55.540
as it's

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:56.660
configured well

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.240
then it can

00:36:58.240 --> 00:36:58.980
do that sort

00:36:58.980 --> 00:36:59.360
of thing

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:01.100
which is

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:01.500
very, very

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:01.840
helpful.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.640
Wow, that's

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.120
really cool.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:04.720
So you don't

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.360
have to go

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.320
get all the

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:06.940
cards and

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:09.680
then who

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:10.260
have all

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:10.780
these different

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:11.460
permissions and

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:12.500
then construct

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.300
some query

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.120
that comes up

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:14.460
with it.

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:15.020
Yeah, very

00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:15.360
nice.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:15.980
I love it.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.520
Yeah, super

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:17.820
cool.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:18.700
And that

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.320
plugs into

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.100
DRF as

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:20.360
well.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.040
So your

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:24.940
serializer

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:25.500
or your

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:26.180
viewset,

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:26.840
so I haven't

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.280
worked in it

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:27.780
in a while,

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:30.160
but the

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:30.700
query that

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.040
gets used

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:33.460
when you

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:34.400
access a

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.600
list API

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.000
endpoint,

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.600
you could

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.160
just apply

00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:38.920
that automatically

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.420
as well.

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.040
So you don't

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.920
need to build

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:43.340
it in that

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.260
case either.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:44.860
so it

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:45.260
plugs into

00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:45.680
all of the

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:45.900
things.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:46.260
It's a little

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:46.740
bit weird at

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:47.140
first to get

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:47.620
used to and

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.300
then it's

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:48.880
just fantastic.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.140
Very cool.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:50.520
Yeah.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:51.460
Yeah.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:52.940
And now

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:54.440
I'm guessing

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.320
much of the

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:55.700
front end

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.240
stuff is

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.360
probably not

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:57.580
there?

00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:58.860
Yeah, yeah.

00:37:58.860 --> 00:37:59.480
So the

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.180
old application

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:00.900
still exists

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.400
but it's

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:01.700
not,

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:03.980
but it's

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:04.940
like the

00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.060
HTMX

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:06.860
based version

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:07.220
would just

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:07.620
be a

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:07.980
drop-in

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:08.520
replacement.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:08.940
It's like

00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:09.460
go to this

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:10.360
URL instead

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:10.960
kind of

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:11.140
thing.

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:11.940
Yeah.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:12.280
Yeah.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.820
Yeah, awesome.

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:18.820
Hold on,

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:19.780
let's see.

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:23.380
So I

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.460
guess now

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:26.120
that it's

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:26.660
done,

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:27.220
you said you

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:27.600
used to work

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.000
there but you

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.500
don't work

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:28.900
there anymore,

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.420
is that right?

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.460
Oh yeah,

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:31.420
not anymore,

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:32.340
as of a few

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:32.780
months ago.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:34.320
Right.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:35.400
So maybe,

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.040
I guess that's

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:36.720
recent enough

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.440
to say sort

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.520
of how is

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.120
it going now,

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:39.340
right?

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.140
how is it

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:40.580
being used?

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:40.800
How are

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.080
people,

00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:41.680
you know,

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.060
is it still

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:42.720
going strong

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:44.360
as the

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:44.920
technology?

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:46.200
Yeah,

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:46.520
the tech

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.420
is solid.

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.420
Yeah,

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.600
so I

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.560
hope that

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:51.880
they're still

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.500
building on it.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.260
There was

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.220
some weird

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.760
things happening

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.200
at the

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:56.740
organization

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.280
before I

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:57.460
left.

00:38:57.460 --> 00:38:59.060
So yeah,

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.820
I expect,

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:01.800
I hope that

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.440
everything is still

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.020
going smoothly

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:03.580
but I haven't

00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:03.960
been plugged

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:04.360
in for a

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:04.540
while.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.220
Yeah,

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:10.020
yeah,

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:10.880
let's give

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.900
maybe a

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.380
quick shout

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:13.120
out to,

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:13.680
gosh,

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.380
let me try

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:14.920
to grab it,

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.300
give it a second.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:15.780
I want to

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:16.140
give a quick

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:16.540
shout out

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:18.560
to this

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.320
video,

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:20.940
this other

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:22.760
DjangoCon talk.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.040
Gosh,

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:23.440
why is,

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.360
I need to

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:24.660
sign into

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:25.020
my YouTube

00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:25.540
premium on

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:25.740
this,

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:26.300
Roger.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.440
But this

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.600
real world

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.240
SaaS product

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.220
example from

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:33.660
this guy

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:34.280
in France,

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:35.040
David

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:35.780
Gilead,

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:36.460
yeah,

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:36.740
that,

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:38.160
that one

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:38.440
you said

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.120
was a pretty

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:39.940
good example

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:40.520
if you need

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.600
like a

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.580
walkthrough case.

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.000
Yeah,

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:44.420
so that one

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:45.080
I didn't see

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:45.960
it live.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.160
I saw a video

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:47.700
of it after

00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:48.160
the fact

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:48.880
but it is

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.680
like the

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:50.100
ultimate

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.160
HTMX demo.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:51.960
It shows,

00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.100
this guy

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:53.580
really makes

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:53.940
it dance.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:54.660
It's quite

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.200
an amazing

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:55.780
thing to see.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:56.980
So,

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:57.980
highly recommend

00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:58.360
that.

00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.520
Yeah,

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:00.020
this guy

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:00.620
David goes

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:01.000
through and

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.220
says,

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:01.520
you know,

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.360
here's our

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.780
complex

00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.660
SaaS product

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:05.780
and let

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:06.180
me walk

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:06.940
you through

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:07.200
all the

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:07.500
features.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.420
I feel like

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:08.680
this would

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.060
be a pretty

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:09.620
good one.

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.920
Your article

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:11.440
as well

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.140
and then

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:12.760
this video

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.720
if you want

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:14.120
to say

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:14.840
make a case

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.160
to your

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:15.780
team like,

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.780
hey,

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:17.300
everyone,

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.020
can we

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:18.720
consider doing

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.000
this?

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:19.800
And I'm

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.860
sure right

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:21.340
off the bat

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:21.640
you'll get

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.020
some folks

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:22.200
say,

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:22.360
well,

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:22.640
no,

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:22.980
we have

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:23.340
to use

00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:23.620
React

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:24.040
because it's

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:24.500
interactive.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:24.920
This,

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:25.440
you interact

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:25.780
with that

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:26.280
part and it

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:26.780
changes that

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:27.020
part.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:27.480
How are we

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:27.660
going to

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:28.180
possibly pull

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:28.540
that off?

00:40:28.540 --> 00:40:28.920
It's like,

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:29.100
yeah,

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:29.280
no,

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.340
that's totally

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:30.740
possible.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:32.180
I think

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:32.460
the main

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:32.800
arguments

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.220
people have

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:33.960
against it

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:34.380
are like

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:34.900
scale,

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:35.640
but that

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:35.940
argument

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:36.580
doesn't make

00:40:36.580 --> 00:40:37.080
super,

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:37.560
a lot of

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:37.860
sense to

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:37.940
me.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:38.200
I think

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:38.420
it might

00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:38.960
be complexity

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:39.540
scale that

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:39.840
they're

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:40.560
concerned about,

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.060
but I think

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:41.640
things like

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.440
template partials

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.200
solve a lot

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:43.440
of that

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:43.840
problem.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.600
And then

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.360
there's,

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.700
can it

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:48.100
do the

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:48.480
things?

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:49.520
And this

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.280
solves that

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:50.600
problem.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.800
And then

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:52.140
is it

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:52.520
really,

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.760
is it

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.580
really a,

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:56.800
is it

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.260
really so

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:57.780
much better

00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:58.120
for the

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:58.480
team?

00:40:58.480 --> 00:40:59.220
Is the

00:40:59.220 --> 00:40:59.380
other

00:40:59.380 --> 00:40:59.740
question?

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:00.060
Is it

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:00.500
just another

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:00.840
fashion?

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.120
Is it

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:01.540
just another

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:01.960
fad?

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.440
And that's

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:02.940
something that's

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:03.420
sometimes hard

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:03.680
to get

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.100
across.

00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:06.160
And I

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:06.540
think that

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.320
my article

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:07.840
will do

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.680
a good

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.440
job of

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:09.980
explaining

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:10.920
why it's

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.120
a good

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:11.520
idea.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:12.140
Because I

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:12.400
had to

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:12.860
explain this

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:13.560
to non-technical

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.300
stakeholders.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.000
I was like,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:15.360
okay,

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.180
I'm making

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:16.720
this crazy

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.440
decision and

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:17.780
this is

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:18.120
why.

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.100
And so I

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:19.340
think I've

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:19.560
got the

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:19.860
argument

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:20.240
down.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.600
Go read

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.120
that article

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:22.560
if you need

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:22.980
to convince

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:23.360
someone.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.040
Yeah.

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.260
But I

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:27.520
think the

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:27.860
other thing

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:28.300
to mention

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:29.240
is the

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:29.940
full stack

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:30.220
that I

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:30.680
moved to

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.000
in the

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:31.500
end.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.340
Yeah,

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:34.120
so HTMX

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:34.420
we spoke

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:34.660
about,

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:35.100
Django we

00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:35.320
spoke

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:35.600
about,

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:36.100
and Alpine

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:36.500
we spoke

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:36.840
about.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.440
Now,

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:38.880
if you

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.100
are running

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.040
a React

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:42.440
front-end

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:42.740
or whatever,

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:43.080
you would

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:43.520
test the

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.040
front-end

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:44.620
in a

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.200
React-y

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:45.480
way,

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:45.920
like you

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.400
would use

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.140
tools that

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:47.240
are

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:47.540
appropriate

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:47.980
for that.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:48.620
And so

00:41:48.620 --> 00:41:48.940
you need

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:49.320
to think

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:49.560
about

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:49.840
different

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:50.140
ways

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:50.440
to

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:50.880
test

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:51.300
things.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.560
Would

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:53.940
that be

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:54.240
like

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:55.060
Selenium

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:55.540
or something

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.000
or what

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:56.180
are we

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:56.440
talking?

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.800
So I

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.040
like

00:41:58.040 --> 00:41:58.500
Playwright

00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:58.940
quite a

00:41:58.940 --> 00:41:59.160
lot.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:41:59.520
So you

00:41:59.520 --> 00:41:59.800
could do

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.000
it with

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.460
Selenium

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:00.900
but that

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:01.200
would be

00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:01.560
a,

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.100
like,

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.140
it would

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:03.480
include

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:03.700
some

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:03.940
pain.

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:05.160
Playwright

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:05.880
is very,

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.360
very lovely

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.320
to work

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:07.620
with.

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:08.300
So it's

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.040
like Selenium

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.100
only with

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.680
all sorts

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.540
of useful

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:14.040
test goodies

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:14.700
built in.

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:15.100
So,

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.200
like,

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:16.580
you can get

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.100
it to

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:18.640
take videos

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.060
of your

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:19.340
failed

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:19.880
tests

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.000
tests

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:20.640
and

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.060
it's

00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:22.400
got

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:22.780
useful

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:23.180
flags

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:23.360
for,

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:23.660
like,

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:24.120
running

00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:24.380
your

00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:24.660
tests

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:24.900
on

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:25.180
different

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:25.580
browsers

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:26.280
and

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:26.940
you

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:27.360
can

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.440
keep

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:29.840
a trace

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:30.020
of

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:30.420
things.

00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:30.640
It's

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:30.880
got

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:31.360
interesting

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:31.760
debugging

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:32.100
stuff

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:32.320
built

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:32.600
in

00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:33.240
and

00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:33.460
you

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:33.580
can

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:33.760
just

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:33.960
run

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:34.080
it

00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:34.220
with

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:34.820
pytest.

00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:36.440
So,

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.600
yeah,

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:37.960
Playwright

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.340
is a big

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:38.640
part of

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:38.880
it as

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:39.120
well.

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.940
Yeah,

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:42.300
Playwright

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:42.640
is really

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:42.840
nice.

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.080
You know,

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:43.440
one thing

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:43.820
that just

00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:44.160
occurred

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:44.580
to me

00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:44.960
around

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:45.140
the

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:45.480
testing

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.740
if

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:46.980
you've

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:47.260
got

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:47.780
a rich

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.300
JavaScript

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:48.780
front-end

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:49.160
sort of

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:49.340
thing,

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.120
you have

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:50.460
to use

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:50.680
something

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.040
like

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:51.600
Playwright

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:51.780
or

00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:52.180
Selenium

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:52.620
where it

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:53.180
does a

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:53.620
full

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.120
browser

00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:54.620
request

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:54.960
render

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:55.320
of the

00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:55.600
page

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:56.520
to

00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:56.860
interact

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:57.260
with it,

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:57.820
right?

00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.500
And you

00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:58.820
can also

00:42:58.820 --> 00:42:59.080
do that

00:42:59.080 --> 00:42:59.220
with

00:42:59.220 --> 00:42:59.800
HTMLX,

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:00.440
but

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.040
a lot

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:02.300
of these

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:02.560
web

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:03.000
frameworks

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:03.900
you can

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:04.360
just

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.380
in your

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:05.960
web

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:06.280
test

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:06.620
code

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:06.940
you can

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:07.140
say

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:07.440
create

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:07.680
like

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:07.940
a

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:08.960
testing

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:09.820
instance

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.200
of my

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:10.600
server,

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.780
right,

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:12.220
and then

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:12.820
make it

00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:13.100
do this

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:13.580
request

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:14.120
and then

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:14.360
see

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:14.580
what

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:14.740
the

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:15.140
response

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:15.380
came

00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:15.620
back

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:16.000
without

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.020
nearly

00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:17.240
the

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:17.400
same

00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:17.700
overhead

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:18.040
and

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:18.580
because

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:19.100
this

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:19.320
stuff

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:19.500
all

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:19.780
happens

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:19.940
on

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:20.060
the

00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:20.340
server,

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:21.340
I

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:21.620
guess

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:21.740
you

00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:21.840
could

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:22.020
just

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:22.240
write

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:22.620
a

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:23.820
unit

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:24.220
test

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:25.620
against

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:26.300
a

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:26.700
fragment

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:27.380
response,

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:27.660
right?

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:29.060
Yeah,

00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:29.720
you can.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:30.100
So you

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:30.960
can write

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.020
little unit

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:32.440
tests that

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:32.880
check different

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.600
things like

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.120
that,

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:35.880
but since

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:36.260
a lot of

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:36.980
the interactivity

00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:37.540
is defined

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:38.020
within the

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:38.900
HTML tags,

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:39.340
your unit

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:40.080
tests won't

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.220
be able to

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:41.880
cover like

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.180
fix this

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:43.480
and that

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:43.900
happens,

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:44.620
so that's

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:45.000
where

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.160
something like

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:46.460
playwright

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:46.760
will come

00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:46.980
in.

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:47.700
Yeah,

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:48.000
you'll still

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:48.420
need that

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:48.620
to,

00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.200
but maybe

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:49.600
less

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.080
playwright

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:51.020
is needed

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:51.840
otherwise,

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:52.460
is what I

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:52.820
was thinking.

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.580
Yeah,

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:53.980
definitely,

00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:54.520
definitely.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:55.100
I think one

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:55.500
of the

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:56.260
anti-patterns

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:56.640
I've seen

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:57.740
is too

00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:57.980
much

00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:58.400
playwright

00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:58.660
where they're

00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:58.960
just like,

00:43:58.960 --> 00:43:59.200
why don't you

00:43:59.200 --> 00:43:59.540
use playwright

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.100
for everything

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:00.540
and then your

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.180
tests are

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:01.840
ridiculously

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:02.660
slow and

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:02.960
it's like,

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:03.200
you could

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:03.580
have just,

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:05.720
you need to

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.060
test the

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:06.240
view,

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:06.620
there was this

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:07.160
function that

00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:07.380
you wanted

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:07.900
to test.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:08.740
Exactly,

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:09.920
you're not

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.240
Shakespeare,

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:10.640
you don't need

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:10.920
that much

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:11.260
playwright,

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:11.620
come on,

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.020
get focused.

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:12.580
Yeah,

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.260
playwright is a

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:15.440
call,

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:16.220
I definitely

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:16.780
recommend it,

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:16.940
yeah.

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:17.720
Yeah,

00:44:17.720 --> 00:44:17.980
yeah,

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:18.800
and it plugs

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:19.300
into Django

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:19.980
really smoothly

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:20.460
as well,

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:20.940
so you don't

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:21.240
actually,

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.280
the playwright,

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.140
it spins up

00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:23.860
a browser and

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:24.440
points it at a

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:25.020
running instance

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:25.800
of an application

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.140
in order to

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:28.980
test the

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:29.300
things,

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.160
but with

00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.360
Django and

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:32.940
pytest,

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:33.700
you can use

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:34.580
a fixture to

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:35.960
spin up a

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.680
test version

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.460
of your

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.300
application,

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:39.740
it's kind of

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:40.080
like run

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:40.680
servers running

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:41.220
there in your

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:41.840
tests anyway,

00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:43.280
so yeah,

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.200
it integrates

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:45.500
very,

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.120
very smoothly,

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.180
yeah,

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:47.760
makes it very

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.140
convenient.

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:49.060
Yeah,

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:49.460
absolutely.

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:50.280
You know,

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:50.740
one of the

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:51.400
things you wrote

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.040
a lot about,

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:52.480
and you

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.400
mentioned this,

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:53.920
but you kind

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.900
of flew past

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:56.300
it a little

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:56.580
bit,

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:57.540
was,

00:44:57.540 --> 00:44:59.420
you said,

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:00.500
am I crazy

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.640
for optimizing

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.220
for junior

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:02.740
developers,

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:03.340
right?

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:05.120
On the other

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:05.580
hand,

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:08.500
on the other

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:08.780
hand,

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:10.600
optimizing for

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:11.260
simplicity,

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.660
even if

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:14.940
you're an

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:15.400
expert,

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:15.740
right,

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:16.120
you don't,

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:16.780
just because you

00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:17.640
can do all

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.100
the steps

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:18.500
and all the

00:45:18.500 --> 00:45:18.860
complexity

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:19.340
doesn't mean

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:20.060
you should

00:45:20.060 --> 00:45:21.460
constantly be

00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:21.880
doing those

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.200
steps,

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:22.480
right?

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:23.820
And so

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:24.740
I think

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.060
there's a

00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:26.440
case for

00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:26.900
optimizing

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:27.560
for simplicity

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:27.840
here.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.080
What do

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:28.360
you think?

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:30.060
I completely

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:30.700
agree.

00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:31.660
I mean,

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:32.320
if you can

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:32.980
just take

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:34.400
the cognitive

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.240
load of

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:36.160
developing your

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:36.540
app and

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:36.940
then make

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:37.620
it simple

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:38.140
so you can

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:38.600
focus on

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:39.140
actually solving

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:39.600
problems

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.660
instead of

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.480
wiring,

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:44.540
I suppose,

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:45.920
and life

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.420
gets a lot

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:47.400
easier.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:47.900
So yeah,

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:48.660
simplicity

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:49.200
rocks.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:52.460
it's

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:52.800
fast to

00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:53.120
develop,

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.720
but things

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.080
like HTMX

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:56.460
make your

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.080
code way,

00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:57.780
way smaller

00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:59.140
than it would

00:45:59.140 --> 00:45:59.880
otherwise be.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.480
So it's not

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.180
just simple.

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:01.640
It's not just

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:02.100
that it's less

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:02.720
convoluted.

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:03.100
There's also

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:03.780
less of it.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:04.220
And so

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:04.980
there's less

00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:05.460
to test.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:06.280
There's less

00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:06.680
stuff that

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.580
can cause

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:07.960
bugs.

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.660
And most

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:10.220
of the

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:11.160
front-end

00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:11.880
interactivity

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.320
is handled

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:12.940
by another

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:13.660
library that's

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:14.100
really well

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:14.440
tested.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.060
And you're

00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:15.500
just doing

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:16.220
these tiny

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:16.880
little things

00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:17.140
that are

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:17.560
easy to

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.160
reason about.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.700
it's

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:21.240
robust

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.180
and

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:22.600
clean.

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.960
So yeah,

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:25.480
I do think

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:25.960
it's worth

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.300
optimizing for

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:27.680
simplicity.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:28.460
I mean,

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:29.100
it made

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:30.780
everybody more

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:31.120
productive,

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:31.620
the juniors

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.820
and me as

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:33.040
well.

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:34.640
So top

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:34.880
notch.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:35.680
Yeah.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.280
I'm

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:38.220
constantly in

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:38.940
pursuit of

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:40.980
trying to

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:41.540
keep things

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:42.080
simple.

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:43.220
You know,

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:43.740
if you go

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:44.500
over to the

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:45.300
HTMX,

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:45.840
I don't know

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:46.180
if you've

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:46.720
looked at

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:47.160
this section,

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:47.600
but they've

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:47.980
got a,

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:48.280
you know,

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:49.100
Kirsten has

00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:49.740
this essay

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:50.240
section,

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.260
which,

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.880
you know,

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:53.920
it's not

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:54.620
quite a blog,

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:54.920
but it's

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:55.340
kind of a

00:46:55.340 --> 00:46:55.620
blog.

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.500
You know,

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.080
it's not in

00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:58.340
order,

00:46:58.340 --> 00:46:58.760
it's in

00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.060
sort of

00:46:59.060 --> 00:46:59.500
category.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:00.660
These are

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:01.000
all nice.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:01.460
One thing

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:01.900
that's nice

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:02.360
is he has

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:02.840
on the

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.400
other hand,

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:04.820
here's a

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:05.240
couple of

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:05.740
examples why

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:06.320
people didn't

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:06.760
pick it,

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:07.240
right?

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:07.900
But he's

00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:08.260
got a whole

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:08.780
section on

00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:09.280
complexity,

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:09.680
very,

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.220
very bad.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.300
Yeah.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.160
But if

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:12.460
you keep

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:12.880
going,

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.600
there's a

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:15.160
bunch of

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:15.440
memes.

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:16.040
The memes are

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:16.600
so good,

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:17.000
aren't they?

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:17.500
They are

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.140
fantastic.

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:19.520
And one

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:19.860
of these

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:20.200
super,

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:20.960
definitely

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:21.600
applies.

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.080
You know,

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:24.500
there's one

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:25.060
that says

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:26.080
HTML plus

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:26.440
the back

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:26.780
end for

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:27.020
like,

00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:27.520
you know,

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:27.720
it's got

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:28.120
this bell

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:28.440
curve for

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:28.920
the beginners,

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.380
like,

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:29.820
oh,

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:30.520
this is what

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:30.820
I want.

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:31.480
As you get

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:31.860
a little bit

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:32.060
better,

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:32.400
you're like,

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:32.680
oh,

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:33.060
I need

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:33.460
all this

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.060
complexity,

00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:35.480
all these

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:35.900
layers.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:36.380
and then

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:37.200
sort of

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:37.940
the Jedi

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:38.700
knight at

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:38.980
the end

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:39.140
is,

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:39.420
yeah,

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:39.900
HTML

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:40.140
on the

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:40.360
back

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:40.540
end,

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:40.700
right?

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.260
Going through

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:42.880
this path

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.660
and I think

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.220
these two

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:46.620
ends,

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:47.420
I don't

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:47.700
necessarily

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:48.020
want to

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:48.440
characterize

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:48.920
beginners

00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:49.260
that look

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:49.680
like this

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.260
character

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:50.560
and this

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:50.740
meme,

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:50.940
but,

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:51.980
you know,

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:53.420
I think

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:53.820
the meme

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:54.740
still speaks

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:55.900
of us

00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:56.140
somewhat,

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:56.480
right?

00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.360
Yeah,

00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:57.600
yeah,

00:47:57.600 --> 00:47:57.960
definitely,

00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:58.520
definitely.

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:01.020
Yeah,

00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:01.300
I think

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:01.780
it's about

00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.660
like when

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:04.240
I teach

00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:04.620
people to

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:04.900
code,

00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:05.340
when I teach

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:05.700
people like

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.020
the very

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:06.560
basics of

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:06.920
code,

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.220
and like

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:09.620
something I

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.100
see with

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:10.660
very junior

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:11.340
developers is

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:11.900
they try to

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:12.340
show off

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:13.080
and be like,

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:13.440
look how

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.220
fancy I can

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:14.560
make my

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:14.760
code,

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:15.500
I can do

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:15.760
all of

00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:15.900
these

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.280
complicated

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:16.860
things,

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:17.260
and then

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:17.640
you get

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:17.920
them to

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:18.280
think more

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:18.880
like Jedi's

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:19.120
and say,

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:19.440
like,

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.280
don't waste

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:20.900
any moves,

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:21.340
like,

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.000
you wouldn't

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:24.440
be flailing

00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:24.820
about,

00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:25.140
like,

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:25.960
this is kind

00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:26.240
of like

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:26.580
flailing.

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.840
HTML

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:30.520
does that

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:30.840
for you,

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.180
it just

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:31.700
lets you

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:32.320
like move

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:32.760
directly

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.320
towards your

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:33.620
goal,

00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:34.320
instead of

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:34.720
having to

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.760
like move

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:36.360
around it.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.000
Yeah.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.160
Yeah,

00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:38.640
it's pretty

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:38.960
glorious.

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:39.780
So,

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:41.940
I know

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:42.220
that you

00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:43.080
do a lot

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:43.660
of teaching,

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:44.860
maybe,

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:46.680
you said

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:46.940
you work

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:47.440
for this

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:48.740
local company

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:49.780
that you

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:50.100
did the

00:48:50.100 --> 00:48:50.620
Kanban board

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:51.000
app for

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:51.500
and so on,

00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:52.760
and now

00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:54.260
what are you

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:54.520
up to?

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.740
So,

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:56.440
still teaching,

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.120
just differently.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.620
So,

00:48:58.620 --> 00:48:59.940
yeah,

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:00.300
it was

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.260
really cool

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:01.800
working there.

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:03.680
I was there

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:04.020
for a long

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:04.340
time,

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:04.780
like five

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:05.160
years in

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:05.460
total,

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:06.120
which is

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.540
really long

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:08.900
and it

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:09.200
was super

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:09.640
successful.

00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:10.240
So,

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:11.500
like,

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:12.640
since 2020,

00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.940
basically

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:14.720
everybody who

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:15.180
passed our

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:15.700
courses ended

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:16.140
up getting

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:16.880
good jobs,

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:17.440
like,

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.420
very,

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:19.040
very close

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:19.780
to 100%

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:20.220
of the people

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:20.680
who passed

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.200
and the people

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:21.520
who didn't

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:21.900
pass is,

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:22.140
like,

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:23.000
actually kind

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:23.320
of small,

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:24.180
like 7%,

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:25.200
and there's

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:25.780
lots of

00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:26.420
reasons for

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:26.680
that.

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:28.120
But,

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:29.100
yeah,

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:29.640
I learned

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:30.000
a ton

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.060
from being

00:49:31.060 --> 00:49:31.400
there.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.060
Was that a

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:33.340
person?

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:34.100
That was a

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.040
person pre-COVID,

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:35.300
right?

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:36.200
Yeah,

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.020
so post-COVID,

00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:38.080
we actually got

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:38.260
way,

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:38.640
way better

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:40.160
because we

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:40.920
had better

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:41.760
monitoring of

00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:42.500
individuals and

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:42.880
we could do

00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:43.240
things like

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.340
track people's

00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:45.280
cards on

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:45.680
their board,

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.400
moving around,

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.680
and then from

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:48.080
that you can

00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:48.260
say,

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:48.480
like,

00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:48.680
oh,

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:49.160
this piece

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:49.640
of content

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.180
is dodgy.

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:50.780
it would

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:51.260
give us

00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:52.320
as educators

00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:52.780
a lot of

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:53.500
feedback about

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:53.940
what we were

00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:54.780
doing because

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:55.760
if a person

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:56.280
was stuck

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.340
and you're

00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:57.520
like,

00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.060
I explained

00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:58.360
this thing

00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:58.640
great,

00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:58.940
and then

00:49:58.940 --> 00:49:59.260
they're still

00:49:59.260 --> 00:49:59.500
stuck,

00:49:59.500 --> 00:49:59.760
you're like,

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.480
I didn't

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.000
explain this

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:01.380
thing great,

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:01.800
and so,

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.360
like,

00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:02.800
the way

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:03.580
the teaching

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:03.980
mechanism

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:04.440
was built

00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:04.880
was,

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:05.820
like,

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:06.200
really good

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:06.440
for the

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:06.840
students,

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:07.220
but,

00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.380
like,

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:09.360
if we as

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:09.940
educators

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:10.900
didn't do

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:11.300
a good job

00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:11.680
on something,

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:12.100
we'd know

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:12.520
about it

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:12.760
and we'd

00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:12.980
have to

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:13.420
fix it,

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:13.940
and I

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:14.340
think that

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:15.720
honed the

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:16.300
craft quite

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:16.700
a lot.

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:17.460
So,

00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:18.220
learned a

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:18.400
bunch

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:18.740
there,

00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:19.540
now what

00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:19.960
I'm doing

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.060
is I want

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:21.620
to spread

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:22.100
those skills

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:22.480
in different

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:22.800
ways.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.160
So,

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:23.940
there's a

00:50:23.940 --> 00:50:25.540
whole lot

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:25.880
to what

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:26.240
I'm doing.

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:28.080
One thing

00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:28.380
I want to

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:29.100
do is

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:29.500
help

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:30.160
educators

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:30.560
themselves,

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.040
so I've

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:31.340
got this

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:31.720
thing called

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.040
the Guild

00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:32.780
of Educators

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:33.140
because I

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:33.640
always wanted

00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:33.960
to Guild,

00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:36.100
and it's

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:36.480
got a

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:36.840
whole lot

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:37.400
of people

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:37.900
in there

00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:38.540
who are,

00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:38.780
like,

00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:39.180
it's a

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:39.320
free

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:39.820
community,

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:40.720
come and

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:40.940
join,

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.460
it's a

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:42.600
bunch

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:42.700
of

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:43.140
education

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:43.560
nerds

00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:43.760
who

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.100
talk

00:50:44.100 --> 00:50:44.320
about

00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:44.780
education

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:45.120
with

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:45.260
each

00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:45.500
other,

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:46.480
it's

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:46.640
a

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.040
support

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:47.580
structure

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:48.140
because I

00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:48.280
think

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:48.700
educators

00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:49.000
need

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:49.280
support

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:49.740
structures

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.060
and it's

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:51.800
a place

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:52.980
to share

00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:55.540
learnings

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:58.020
and share

00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:58.520
resources

00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.260
and opportunities

00:50:59.260 --> 00:50:59.720
and things

00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:00.100
like that.

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:00.260
So,

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:00.540
it's still

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:01.060
very new,

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:01.560
but that's

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.000
one part

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:02.360
of it.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:03.920
I want to

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.320
offer teacher

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:04.920
training and

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:05.260
things like

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:05.600
that.

00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.240
just like

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:07.880
we have

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:08.120
junior

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:08.660
developers,

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:10.160
people got

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:10.420
to start

00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:10.720
somewhere

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:10.960
with

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:11.280
teaching

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:11.600
and

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:11.980
teaching

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:12.320
online

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:12.640
is

00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:12.980
different,

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:13.440
all that.

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:14.540
Yeah,

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:14.940
yeah,

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:15.480
and it's

00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.280
hard because

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:16.780
there aren't

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:17.200
really good

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:17.980
resources for

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:18.760
tech educators.

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:21.160
If you dig

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:22.040
into the

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.340
literature on

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:24.280
how learning

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:24.940
works and

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:25.440
how teaching

00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:25.860
works,

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:27.360
it's all

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:27.940
either very

00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:28.360
academic,

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.300
and so it's

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:29.600
a little bit

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:29.980
hard to

00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:30.320
pass,

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.760
it's

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:33.560
just not

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.320
packaged well

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.240
for the

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:36.580
people who

00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:37.040
need it,

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:38.220
or it's

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:38.720
packaged in

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.000
the wrong

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:39.320
way.

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:39.560
So,

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.180
I came across

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:40.760
a code school

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:41.680
recently who,

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.280
I was like,

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:42.680
how do you

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:43.060
handle your

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:43.580
teacher training?

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:43.960
And they're

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:44.180
like,

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:45.060
we outsource

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:45.460
it to these

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:45.780
guys.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:46.280
And they

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:46.620
showed me

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:46.980
this other

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:47.660
organization

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:48.820
that does

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:49.380
teacher training

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.080
and it's

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:51.940
like,

00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:52.220
I dug

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:52.580
through their

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:53.460
courses and

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.200
one of their

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:54.800
selling points

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:55.380
was like,

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:55.780
our teacher

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:56.300
training courses

00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:56.640
are so

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:57.240
versatile that

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:57.720
they can be

00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.340
used for

00:51:58.340 --> 00:51:58.820
florists

00:51:58.820 --> 00:51:59.640
and

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.140
personal

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:00.540
trainers.

00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:00.920
I was like,

00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:01.920
yeah,

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.640
maybe not

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:05.540
appropriate for

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:06.300
what we're up

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:06.660
to here.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:08.520
But that's

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:08.800
what people

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:09.320
are relying

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:09.540
on.

00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:10.040
That's like

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:10.520
the best

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:10.760
that the

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:11.160
industry has

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:11.540
to offer.

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:11.960
So,

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:12.560
I think

00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:12.860
there's a

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:14.280
big hole

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.080
in like

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.160
the education

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:17.740
space and

00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:18.300
I want to

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.120
work to

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:19.740
fill that.

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:21.180
So,

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:21.900
that's

00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.660
part of

00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:23.920
what I'm

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.260
doing and

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:24.540
the other

00:52:24.540 --> 00:52:24.980
part is

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:25.320
offering

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:25.700
technical

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:26.060
training.

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:28.200
And this

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:28.680
is partially

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:29.280
because

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.920
you've

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:31.120
got to

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:32.100
practice

00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:32.740
the craft

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:33.640
partially

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:34.260
because

00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:35.820
I want

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:36.040
to

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:36.420
create

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:36.980
opportunities

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:37.440
for

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:37.960
educators

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:38.260
to

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:38.400
get

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:38.660
good

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:40.280
partially

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:40.640
because

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:40.900
I

00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:41.420
really

00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:41.660
like

00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:41.920
teaching

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:42.120
this

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:42.380
stuff.

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:43.320
So,

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:43.700
there's all

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:44.060
different

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:44.520
reasons

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.980
why I'm

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:47.480
teaching.

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:48.200
So,

00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.720
right now I'm

00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:50.120
building out

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:50.380
a bunch

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:51.740
of small

00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:52.420
workshops

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:52.920
that cover

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:53.220
different

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:53.720
skills and

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.060
are fairly

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:54.480
standalone.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.800
and those

00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:57.320
are Lego

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:58.200
blocks that

00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.080
will combine

00:52:59.080 --> 00:52:59.620
into something

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:00.060
much bigger

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:00.600
in the future.

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:01.640
But for

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:01.980
now,

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:03.780
the first

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:04.300
workshop that

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:04.940
I have on

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:05.860
offer is

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:06.500
all about

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:07.180
Django and

00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:07.900
HTMX.

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:08.800
Oh, yeah.

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:09.080
Okay.

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.140
Yeah.

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:10.860
So, it's

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:12.480
pretty exciting.

00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:14.360
So, it

00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:14.840
talks about the

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.300
stack that we

00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:15.680
just spoke

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:15.940
about.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:16.520
We didn't

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:16.820
mention

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:17.240
Tailwind,

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:17.780
but Tailwind

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:18.200
is great

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:18.600
as well.

00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:19.420
It means

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:19.920
that I can

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:20.560
make front

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:20.920
ends that

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:21.460
look reasonable.

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:23.140
That's right.

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:23.620
You said

00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:23.960
you had

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:24.180
used

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:25.000
Material UI

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:25.560
previously

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.040
to make

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:26.420
it good.

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:27.800
And Tailwind

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.540
is what

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:28.920
used in

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:29.340
the new

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:29.640
version?

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.640
Yeah.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:30.860
Yeah.

00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:31.240
Yeah.

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:31.960
Excellent.

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:32.700
Yeah.

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:33.140
I'm really

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:33.440
enjoying

00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:33.840
Tailwind.

00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:34.460
Yeah.

00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:35.380
So, the

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:35.800
idea with

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:36.120
this little

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:36.520
workshop,

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.040
I ran

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:38.880
it as

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:39.340
part of

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:39.900
DjangoCon

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:40.740
US recently

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:41.200
and it was

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:41.840
super cool.

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:43.860
I got,

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:44.620
I don't know,

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:44.980
there were way

00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:45.580
too many people

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:45.900
there,

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.440
which was

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:47.380
great.

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:48.080
That's a

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:48.500
good problem.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:49.040
It's a

00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:49.360
very good

00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:49.520
problem.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:49.560
It's a

00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:49.940
good problem

00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:50.360
to solve.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:50.700
It's like,

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:51.020
whoa,

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:51.980
all of you.

00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:53.480
So, that

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:53.820
was super

00:53:53.820 --> 00:53:54.220
cool and

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:54.860
went really

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:55.120
well.

00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.300
The basic

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:57.280
idea is that

00:53:57.280 --> 00:53:59.500
I want to

00:53:59.500 --> 00:53:59.980
show how

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:00.700
to build

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:01.620
a CRUD

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.140
application

00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:02.820
using the

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:03.180
stack of

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:04.460
tools in

00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:05.120
a way that

00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.620
sets people

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:07.240
up to be

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:07.480
able to

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:07.800
build their

00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.300
own stuff.

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:08.740
And part

00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:08.940
of the

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:09.520
workshop is,

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:09.940
in fact,

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:11.160
taking these

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:11.600
tools and

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:12.040
building your

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:12.480
own thing.

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.820
for people

00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:15.140
who are

00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.020
early on

00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:16.580
their career,

00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:18.860
they can

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:19.920
get the

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.340
starts of

00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:20.780
decent

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:21.380
portfolio

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.060
projects out

00:54:22.060 --> 00:54:22.320
of it.

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:22.940
People

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:23.340
built all

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:23.620
sorts of

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:23.900
interesting

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:24.280
things.

00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:24.460
So,

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:25.140
the one

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:25.580
person

00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:26.580
built their

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:27.360
own personal

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.200
learner management

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:28.920
system for

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:29.440
their own

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:29.720
learning,

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:30.080
which was

00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:30.300
really

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:30.620
lovely.

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:32.140
Somebody

00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:32.720
built a

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:33.640
music store.

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:34.380
Somebody

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.000
else built

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:35.640
a,

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.780
what was

00:54:36.780 --> 00:54:37.080
it,

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:37.840
like a

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.140
chore

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.020
manager for

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:40.080
their family

00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:40.740
so that they

00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:41.180
don't fight

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:41.700
so much.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.500
it was

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:44.900
all with

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:45.260
Django,

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:45.680
HTML,

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:46.220
and Alpine

00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:46.620
JS.

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:49.800
And the

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:50.180
other thing

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:50.580
that's cool

00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:51.040
about this

00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:52.460
is it's a

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:52.680
CRUD

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.240
application.

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.120
I'm teaching

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.000
people the

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:55.620
bits and

00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:56.360
pieces that

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.220
build a CRUD

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:57.460
app.

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:58.740
And most

00:54:58.740 --> 00:54:59.020
of the

00:54:59.020 --> 00:54:59.760
internet is

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:00.220
CRUD

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:00.820
applications.

00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:02.460
For the

00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:02.760
audience,

00:55:02.760 --> 00:55:03.460
if anybody

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:03.900
hasn't heard

00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:04.220
of CRUD,

00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:04.680
it's create,

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:05.060
read,

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:05.460
update,

00:55:05.460 --> 00:55:05.820
delete.

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:06.600
That's most

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:06.960
of what you

00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:07.380
need to do

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:07.620
on the

00:55:07.620 --> 00:55:07.880
internet.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:08.840
And so,

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:09.380
if you get

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:09.880
the patterns

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:11.840
down for

00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:12.160
like a

00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:12.640
simple CRUD

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:12.900
app,

00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:13.580
then you

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:14.160
can do

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:14.620
some pretty

00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:14.960
hardcore

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:15.460
things with

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:15.660
it.

00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:16.340
So,

00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:16.500
yeah,

00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:16.980
this is,

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:17.740
so it's

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:17.980
covering

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:18.340
that.

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:19.720
The

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:19.960
workshop

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:20.160
is

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:20.520
small,

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:21.940
so it's

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:22.840
like I'm

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:23.060
keeping

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:23.640
things very,

00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:24.260
very small

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:25.580
intentionally

00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:26.700
because I

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.500
believe in

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:28.800
the power

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:29.240
of teachers

00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:29.640
and I

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:29.820
want to

00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:30.100
make sure

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:30.360
that

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:30.900
everybody

00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:31.160
gets

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:31.560
attention

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.580
and gets

00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:32.940
the support

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:33.220
that they

00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:33.480
need.

00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.760
And also

00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:35.040
because

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:35.640
the people

00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.180
who tend

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:36.460
to come

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:36.820
to these

00:55:36.820 --> 00:55:37.060
kinds

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:37.180
of

00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:37.540
things

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.060
have

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:38.300
different

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:38.760
backgrounds.

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:38.960
So,

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:39.340
some people

00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:39.820
need help

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:40.020
here,

00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:40.420
some people

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:40.900
need help

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:41.160
there,

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:41.460
and so

00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:41.900
you need

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:42.240
to keep

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:42.800
a good

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:43.660
ratio of

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:44.140
teachers to

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:44.540
students.

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:45.300
So,

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.080
yeah,

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:46.740
expert-led,

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:47.500
high support,

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.180
small group,

00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.020
all of that

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:50.560
good stuff.

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:51.520
I'm quite excited.

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.720
That's very cool.

00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:53.700
I'll link to this

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:54.880
workshop in the

00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:55.400
show notes if you

00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:55.780
want to check it

00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:55.920
out.

00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:57.780
and it's

00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:58.560
out of time,

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:01.340
but it's

00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:01.900
remote,

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:02.580
so people can

00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:02.980
attend from

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:03.200
wherever,

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:03.440
right?

00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:03.720
You don't

00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:04.320
have to be

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.480
near you.

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:06.660
Yeah,

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:07.180
so you don't

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:07.540
need to be

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:07.780
in South

00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:08.060
Africa.

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:08.460
In fact,

00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:09.080
I made it

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.300
in U.S.

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:11.000
Eastern time

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:11.760
because,

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:12.920
strangely enough,

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:13.420
most of the

00:56:13.420 --> 00:56:14.340
people who

00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:15.580
read my blog

00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:16.600
are in the

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:16.980
U.S.

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:18.300
So,

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:18.740
it's U.S.

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:19.120
and South

00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:19.460
Africa,

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:20.000
and it

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.060
shifts and

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:22.880
changes around.

00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:25.420
part of the

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:25.860
reason I'm

00:56:25.860 --> 00:56:26.400
marketing it

00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:27.260
to the U.S.

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:28.860
is because I

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:29.500
want to be able

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:29.940
to fund

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:31.260
training Africans,

00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:32.560
and,

00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:33.460
like,

00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:34.240
there just

00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:34.940
isn't as much

00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:35.660
money on the

00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:36.180
side of the

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:36.600
world.

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:37.340
So,

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:38.240
yeah,

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:38.600
I want to be

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.320
able to

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:41.420
make doing

00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:42.320
good in the

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:42.900
tech education

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:43.440
space into

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:43.940
something that's

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:44.300
financially

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:44.800
sustainable.

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:45.120
So,

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:45.860
that's why

00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:47.160
the U.S.,

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:47.620
and that is

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:48.660
why it's

00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:49.220
priced in

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:49.560
dollars.

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.560
Yeah.

00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:52.080
So,

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.040
you guys

00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:54.360
can have

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:55.240
a discount

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:55.720
code,

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.740
talkpython,

00:56:57.740 --> 00:56:58.640
talk underscore

00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.060
python.

00:56:59.060 --> 00:56:59.500
I think that

00:56:59.500 --> 00:56:59.960
was the one I

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:00.080
said.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:00.740
Yeah,

00:57:00.740 --> 00:57:01.100
I'll put it

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:01.500
in show notes.

00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:01.940
People can

00:57:01.940 --> 00:57:02.480
find it there.

00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.560
Awesome.

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:04.020
So,

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:04.400
you'll get

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:05.380
10% off,

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:06.480
and then I

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:06.880
also want to

00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:07.120
give,

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:07.420
like,

00:57:07.420 --> 00:57:08.120
another 10%

00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:10.020
to something.

00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:11.200
So,

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:12.540
Foxley

00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:14.080
wanted me to

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:14.620
give 10%

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:15.080
from their

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:15.780
discount code

00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:17.320
to the

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:17.860
DSF.

00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:18.200
So,

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:19.380
that's another

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:19.820
code that's

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:20.200
out there.

00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:20.640
So,

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.160
that's fantastic.

00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.280
I've definitely

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:23.120
benefited a lot

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:23.380
from the

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:23.880
DSF,

00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:24.460
so that's

00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:24.780
really,

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:25.280
really cool.

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:26.000
So,

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.600
since this is

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:28.160
your podcast,

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:28.920
should the

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:29.600
further 10%

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:30.240
go to the

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:30.880
DSF or

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:31.800
PSF or

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.540
the Django

00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:34.440
Con Africa

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.180
event?

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:36.760
Oh,

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.220
my goodness.

00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:38.400
I vote

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.600
Django

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.780
Con Africa.

00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:42.220
Fantastic.

00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:42.840
I was hoping

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:43.320
that you'd say

00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:43.620
that.

00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:44.340
Yeah,

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:44.800
I love Django

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:45.260
Con Africa.

00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:45.740
It's so

00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:46.240
freaking cool.

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:47.960
speaking of

00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:48.680
conference

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:49.240
and talks

00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:49.620
and stuff,

00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:50.620
Kim out

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:50.800
in the

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:51.080
audience

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:51.540
says,

00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:52.080
in a few

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:52.320
weeks,

00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:52.760
a really

00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:53.280
good talk

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:53.880
Sina gave

00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:55.500
at South

00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:55.960
Africa

00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.940
PyCon.

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.960
A few

00:57:58.960 --> 00:57:59.260
weeks ago,

00:57:59.260 --> 00:57:59.520
it should be

00:57:59.520 --> 00:57:59.840
online.

00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:00.660
Power to

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:01.020
the people

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:01.600
who teach

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:02.380
the people

00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:02.820
to code.

00:58:02.820 --> 00:58:03.660
Yes,

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:04.160
that's the

00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:05.380
longest title

00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:06.180
I've had

00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:06.780
for a talk

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:07.020
ever.

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:08.500
Thanks,

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:08.820
Kim.

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:09.440
Yeah,

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:09.820
so I did

00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:10.300
that talk

00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:11.020
at PyCon

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:11.300
South

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:11.560
Africa,

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:11.860
and I

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:12.300
also did

00:58:12.300 --> 00:58:12.540
it,

00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:13.240
I did

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.760
a longer

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.360
version of

00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:15.900
it at

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:16.240
Django

00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:16.680
Con US

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:17.520
as a

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:17.760
keynote,

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.200
so I was

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:18.700
super,

00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:19.720
super happy

00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:20.460
that I got

00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:21.180
that opportunity.

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:21.680
It's so

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:21.960
cool.

00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:23.540
But yeah,

00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:23.760
it just

00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:24.460
talks about

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:26.240
kind of

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:26.600
how I

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:27.060
think about

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:27.440
teaching

00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.140
and how

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:28.580
I,

00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:30.340
so it's

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:30.920
how I

00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:31.280
think about

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:31.600
teaching

00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.480
and the

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:33.080
mechanisms

00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:33.940
that we

00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:34.520
set up,

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:35.580
so like

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:36.360
how does

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:36.980
mastery-based

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:37.540
learning work

00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:37.820
and how

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:38.300
do you

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:40.180
actually

00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:40.420
get,

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:41.160
how do

00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:41.280
you

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:41.740
engineer

00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:42.600
an

00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:43.160
education

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:43.700
system

00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:44.280
so that

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:44.900
it sets

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:45.380
people up

00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:45.980
for success

00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:46.440
and not

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:47.120
like either

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:47.640
frustration

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:48.540
or boredom

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:49.520
like,

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:50.820
because there's

00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:51.260
a lot of

00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:51.980
things that

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:52.320
are weird

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:52.900
about the

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:53.600
traditional

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.440
systems.

00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.100
Yeah,

00:58:56.100 --> 00:58:56.560
so it talks

00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.000
about that,

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:57.400
but then it

00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.060
also shares

00:58:58.060 --> 00:58:58.640
a bunch

00:58:58.640 --> 00:58:59.580
of lessons

00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:00.640
for individual

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:01.340
educators on

00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:01.700
the ground.

00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:02.800
So that

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.080
thing that I

00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:03.420
was talking

00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:04.060
about earlier

00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:04.900
about how

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:06.440
we as

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:07.000
educators

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:07.340
in the

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:07.740
system

00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:08.580
were getting

00:59:08.580 --> 00:59:09.160
like a ton

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:09.680
of feedback

00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:10.320
about our

00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:10.940
own,

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:12.080
the quality

00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:12.600
of our

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:12.960
work,

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.720
that gave

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:15.220
us space

00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:16.060
to figure

00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:16.760
out a lot

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:17.840
of hard-hitting

00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:18.180
things.

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:19.180
So it's

00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:19.840
kind of the

00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:20.620
80-20 of

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:21.960
what teachers

00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:22.980
or would-be

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:23.760
teachers should

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.760
focus on.

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:26.320
And I think

00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:26.840
it's powerful

00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.460
because a lot

00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:27.900
of, like,

00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:28.760
everybody teaches.

00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:29.220
I mean,

00:59:29.220 --> 00:59:29.780
you teach,

00:59:29.780 --> 00:59:31.260
people teach

00:59:31.260 --> 00:59:31.680
new team

00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.180
members,

00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:34.060
like,

00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:34.700
there's a lot

00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:35.160
of volunteer

00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:35.940
teachers as

00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:36.240
well,

00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:38.320
which is great.

00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:40.020
I think

00:59:40.020 --> 00:59:40.640
doing this

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:41.040
kind of

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:41.740
presentation,

00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:42.580
this kind

00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:42.900
of teaching

00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:43.420
is a

00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:45.100
super cheat

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:45.440
code for

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:45.920
leveling up

00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:46.420
your own

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:46.800
skills.

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:47.540
Yeah,

00:59:47.540 --> 00:59:48.000
definitely.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:48.880
There's this

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:49.200
thing called

00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.160
protégé effect,

00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:51.880
which is a

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:52.420
well-studied

00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:52.720
thing.

00:59:52.720 --> 00:59:53.900
So when

00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:54.580
people say

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:55.340
teaching is a

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:55.860
great way to

00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:56.100
learn,

00:59:56.100 --> 00:59:56.900
they're not

00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:57.360
just being

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:57.740
squishy.

00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:58.560
Like,

00:59:58.560 --> 00:59:59.180
it's legit.

00:59:59.180 --> 00:59:59.900
It's really,

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:00.480
really legit.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:01.540
and there

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:02.980
are a lot

01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.200
of mechanisms

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:04.980
behind it.

01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:05.660
It's like,

01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:07.920
one of the

01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:08.520
simple ones

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:08.880
is that

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:09.920
teaching is

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.900
spaced repetition

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:11.880
and recall,

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.740
and that helps

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.060
you remember

01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:13.580
your stuff.

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.440
Another one

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.100
is, like,

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:16.720
people will

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:17.460
ask you weird

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:18.060
questions that

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:18.360
you wouldn't

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:18.760
expect,

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:19.240
and so you

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:19.620
look at your

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:20.120
own knowledge

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:20.420
from a

01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:20.600
different

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.080
direction,

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:21.720
and you

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:22.240
build better

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:22.540
mental

01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:23.060
frameworks,

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.680
or more

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.020
robust

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:25.300
mental

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:25.820
frameworks.

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:26.540
Like,

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:26.940
some people

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:27.860
are good

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:28.920
at building

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.220
mental

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:29.640
frameworks,

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:30.000
and some

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:30.640
people aren't

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.180
as good,

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:33.000
and a

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:33.340
good way

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:33.780
to, like,

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:34.200
get a

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:34.640
person to

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:35.020
build good

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:35.260
mental

01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:35.620
frameworks

01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:36.000
is to

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:36.440
ask them

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:36.680
weird,

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.400
like,

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:37.760
left-side

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.160
questions

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:38.560
about the

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:38.880
stuff they

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.100
know,

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:39.980
and get

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.240
them to

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:40.500
look at

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:40.820
things from

01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:41.060
different

01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:41.380
angles,

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:41.680
so you

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.200
get that

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:42.880
from the

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:43.320
people you're

01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:43.620
teaching.

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:44.100
It's,

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:44.360
yeah,

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:44.640
it's a

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:44.860
really,

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:45.240
it's a

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:45.440
beautiful

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:45.760
thing.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:46.480
Yeah,

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:46.860
it really

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:47.100
is.

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:47.480
It definitely

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:47.960
rounds out

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:48.100
your

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:48.440
knowledge,

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.080
and makes

01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:50.740
you think

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:51.360
deeply about

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:51.640
some of

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.080
these ideas

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:52.340
that you

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:52.560
just

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.200
maybe

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:53.600
glossed

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:53.740
over.

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:53.980
Yeah,

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:54.900
yeah,

01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:55.340
well,

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.500
I think

01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.040
this is

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.620
probably a

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:57.980
good place

01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:58.340
to leave it.

01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:58.620
Let's,

01:00:58.620 --> 01:00:58.920
I want to

01:00:58.920 --> 01:00:59.140
give out

01:00:59.140 --> 01:00:59.580
one more

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:00.020
resource

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:00.520
real quick

01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.040
for people

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:02.940
is just

01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:03.560
awesome

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:04.340
HTMX

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:04.760
over on

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.020
GitHub.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:05.320
I don't

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:05.580
know if

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:05.740
you've

01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:05.920
poked

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.140
around

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:06.360
this,

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:06.660
but

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.840
it's

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.180
got

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.120
many,

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:09.380
many

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:09.840
examples

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.380
of tools

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.040
and libraries

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:12.820
for

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:15.220
HTMX

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:16.060
in Python,

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:16.600
but also

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.020
in a ton

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:17.540
of other

01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:17.900
languages.

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:18.320
so

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.500
like

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:21.700
apparently

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:22.020
there's

01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:22.120
a

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:22.460
Flask

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.340
HTMX

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:23.800
Tailwind

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:24.140
one

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:24.580
and

01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.920
one

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:26.280
for

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.360
sockets

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:27.880
or maybe

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:28.480
HTMX

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:28.840
over web

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:29.080
sockets.

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:29.360
I don't

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:29.520
know.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:29.800
These

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:30.100
all look

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:30.280
pretty

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:30.520
cool,

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:30.920
so

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.320
people

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:32.580
can

01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:32.840
check

01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:33.040
them

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:33.260
out.

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:33.560
But

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:34.340
yeah.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:34.960
Yeah,

01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.120
fantastic.

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:36.820
And I

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:37.040
definitely

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:37.340
want to

01:01:37.340 --> 01:01:37.660
recommend

01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:37.980
people

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:38.320
check

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:38.500
out

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:38.820
your

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:39.560
essay

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.700
and

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.340
yeah,

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:41.540
they

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:41.760
could

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.560
take

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:42.740
these

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:43.140
ideas

01:01:43.140 --> 01:01:43.340
and

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:43.480
run
