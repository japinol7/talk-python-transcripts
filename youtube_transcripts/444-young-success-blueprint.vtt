00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
>> Sydney, welcome to Talk by Phonemy.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.600
It's awesome to have you here.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.600
>> Thanks.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.600
I'm excited to be here.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.600
>> Yeah.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.320
It's really cool to have you here.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.320
Lovely to have somebody who has a brand new experience in the whole software industry,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.400
and you've certainly found a lot of early success.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.920
So that's great, and you're here to share it with everyone.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.320
So happy to have you here.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.320
>> Yeah.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.680
I'm super excited to talk about it.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.960
>> Yeah, so we're going to talk about your experience.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.000
You're working on some pretty awesome projects, and as we were just talking before we hit

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.840
record, you're still in college, still finishing up your last year of college at Madison, which

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:40.840
is excellent.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.080
So I think you'll be an inspiration and provide a lot of good tips for people who are just

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.800
getting into the software industry.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.800
Nice.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:51.800
All right.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.920
Well, before we get to that, though, just tell people a quick bit about yourself.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.920
Who are you?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.920
>> Yeah, sure.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.880
So my name is Sydney, obviously.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.600
I'm currently a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.080
I'm studying computer science.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.720
I actually started off in both engineering and computer science, but decided that I loved

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.960
computer science enough that I just wanted to focus on that.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.960
>> Yeah.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.960
Why'd you switch?

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.320
What engineering discipline were you in?

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.200
>> I was in electrical engineering, so there was a decent amount of crossover between the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.240
two, but I was just finding that I really liked my more advanced CS classes more than

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.240
the advanced engineering classes.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.400
>> Way long ago, I think the way you kind of got a computer science degree is you did

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.160
an electrical engineering degree, and you're like, "Oh, that has to do with electrons and

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.080
circuitry, and that's computers, isn't it?"

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.360
So same thing, right?

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.080
Now it's way more focused, right?

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.040
Like the software side of education, isn't it?

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.040
>> Yeah, definitely.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.760
And the nice thing is we still have some cross-listed classes, so I still get to kind of dip my

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.320
toes in both sides.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.320
>> Yeah, excellent.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.640
>> Yeah, so I grew up in North Carolina originally in Chapel Hill.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.520
Really loved it, but for some reason decided to move up to where it's quite cold.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.760
And yeah, I really enjoyed my time at Madison thus far.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.320
I think it's a great place to learn about CS.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.320
>> Cool.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.680
I have some really good friends who were there for grad school at Madison and just loved

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.680
it.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.200
And I think as we come into November that perhaps the weather's a little different than

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.520
North Carolina, which is, you know, sometimes it gets chilly.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.520
>> Yeah.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.760
I'm getting some new, like, nice winter experiences, you know?

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.000
>> Yes, of course.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.560
Of course.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.560
Well, let's set the stage a little bit by talking about what you're doing so people

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.560
get a sense, right?

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.840
Like, obviously, Madison, for those who don't know, is a super highly respected school,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.440
so it's a pretty top-tier computer science department there.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.760
That alone is pretty awesome.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.560
The fact you're about to graduate, it's pretty awesome.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.120
But you're also working on some cool open-source/funded, I guess.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.160
I don't know what the term for that is, like, backed open-source, but working with Pydantic.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.440
So yeah, talk a bit about what you're doing these days.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.960
>> Yeah, so I'm currently working part-time at Pydantic.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.760
I know you've had Samuel and some others on the team on the show before.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.280
But I reached out to Samuel kind of later in the summer, actually, after I heard him

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.720
talk on your podcast at PyCon and asked if they were interested in having an intern,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.700
you know, help with some of the open-source work, because obviously they're delving into

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.840
new commercial things now.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.560
And Samuel got back to me.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.680
And so now I'm primarily working on open-source there.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.840
I help with, you know, incoming issues and new feature requests, et cetera.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.760
We're currently working on the version 2.5 release, which has lots of new features and

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.040
fixes, which is great.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.680
And it has certainly been the job where I've learned the most the fastest.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.280
I think being surrounded by other developers who have tons of open-source experience makes

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.520
such a collaborative and fast-moving team.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.000
So I've really enjoyed being able to learn so much and dive into this really well-thought-out

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.160
and well-developed code base and kind of go from there.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.440
- That's awesome.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.480
Yeah, Samuel is a great guy.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.880
The Pydantic project, it's really taken the world by storm, wouldn't you say?

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.960
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.080
The number of downloads per month, I think, recently we hit over a million downloads per

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.440
month is quite impressive and, you know, crazy given that it only started a couple

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.040
years ago.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.840
- I think that I saw...

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.280
I can't remember.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:47.160
Was it an ex-Twitter post or was it a Mastodon post that Samuel had put up there that Pydantic

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.520
had been, at this point, downloaded over a billion times, which is kind of unimaginable.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.480
- Yeah, it's quite crazy.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.160
I haven't taken a math class super recently, but I know that it's quite a large number.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.160
- That's right.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.240
It's definitely large, a lot of zeros.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.960
So I pulled up the GitHub page here for Pydantic and it says the project is used by 270,000

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.640
other GitHub projects.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.800
- Yeah, it's definitely quite ingrained in a lot of projects, obviously.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.680
Also used to support a lot of other popular open-source projects, like the one that comes

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.880
to mind immediately is FastAPI, which obviously many of the podcast listeners also know about.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.800
But it's exciting that it's able to serve as such a consistent foundational block for

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.840
so many other libraries.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.560
- Yeah, it really is.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.440
The podcast website's based on Beanie, which is MongoDB plus Pydantic.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.720
And I was literally just working on some FastAPI code.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.560
I'm like, "Oh, I've got to put this away.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.360
I've got to do the podcast with Sydney."

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:57.240
So yeah, it's definitely something that's pretty wild.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.880
I don't know about how you feel about this, but does it make you a little bit nervous

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.240
to work on a project that affects so many people?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.960
- Yeah, that's a good question.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.200
I think starting off, I thought I would feel a bit more nervous.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.400
But once I got into the swing of things, I think we have a really great code review system

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.400
there.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.640
So I feel supported, even though if I'm making changes that seem kind of new or different

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.560
to me, I feel like we have a great team.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.880
And not only just the team at Pydantic, but obviously other open source contributors that

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.720
can kind of give feedback, et cetera.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.640
And it's nice to be able to rely on them for feedback before, obviously, we release too.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.080
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.880
Right below the used by count is the contributors, and there's 447, at least directly to Pydantic.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.840
I don't know the Pydantic one, maybe there's a Pydantic core that's a separate repo these

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.840
days?

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.840
Because there used to be one thing, but then the whole V2 was about splitting that up,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.840
right?

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.840
- Yeah, exactly.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.840
So we have a core written in Rust that handles a lot of the validation and serialization

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.840
logic now.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.680
- Yeah, very cool.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.160
So you're about to graduate.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.000
You talked about jumping into this project and learning so much.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.080
I had a really similar experience when I was in grad school.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.960
I was studying math, and then I got to work on some actual software projects, and they

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.960
were desktop apps.

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.800
Can you believe it back then?

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.120
But really, really fun projects though.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.280
And I had the same experience, like, wow, I've learned so much here, and I did less

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.000
computer science in college, because I studied math and computer science minor.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:43.840
But still, my interactions with my computer science side of those courses, I felt they

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.520
were a little bit, I mean, I guess you should be this way, they felt a little academic,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.880
being at the university.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.960
And a little bit not entirely in touch with, like, what's the latest way of writing code?

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.400
What's the latest technologies?

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.400
What's the latest open source?

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.400
Or what's the latest tools?

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.360
It's been a long time, let's say.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.960
Couple years since I did that in the mid-90s.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.760
You've totally changed.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:11.760
What's your experience?

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.760
Is it similar?

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.960
Or how is it you feel this new project kind of gave you a lot of exposure?

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.160
Yeah, I would say my experience has been quite similar, kind of with the juxtaposition of

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:27.800
standards in my computer science classes and more academic applications of computer science

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.320
versus in my various internships.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.280
I think that's been one of the most valuable things about seeking out diverse opportunities

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:42.320
outside of classes, really being able to get experience with version control systems and

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.760
continuous deployment systems, and how do I work on a code review?

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.280
How do I interpret a code review?

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.480
And then beyond that, just modern coding standards and current libraries, et cetera.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.920
So I definitely do think there is a gap.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.200
But I do think there's still a lot of value in some of the fundamental concepts that are

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:06.720
language agnostic or just easier to learn in a classroom and aren't quite as dependent

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.600
on code quality and production quality, et cetera.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:16.080
But I think it's also really important to get the experience outside of class that gives

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.960
a lot more feedback as to, is this good code?

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.960
Is this bad code?

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.960
Et cetera.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.280
Because that's certainly not something that's really emphasized in class.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:30.400
Even if they try, I think one thing that's super hard to simulate is working on a team

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.960
where stuff is used by other people and there are consequences.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.040
It's one thing to say, "Well, we're going to pretend to do a PR and how'd that go for

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.040
you?"

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:43.360
It's another to say, "We're going to take down 270,000 projects if we get this wrong."

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.560
So the continuous integration should probably be working, right?

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.000
Yeah, definitely.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.880
What languages has your courses mostly been in?

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:01.840
So our foundational computer science courses, learning about data structures, et cetera,

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.840
are in Java.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:07.960
There are a couple of on-ramp courses that you can take in Python if you've never really

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.960
learned code before.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.280
Obviously, that's a little bit easier to get started with.

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:17.680
And then I've taken some courses in C as well that are more architecture related, et cetera.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.760
And now that I'm past the intro, past the computer architecture and into the elective

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.760
focus classes, we've pivoted back to Python.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.400
I think part of that is I'm taking a lot of more data science and machine learning focus

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.400
classes.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.640
And so obviously, Python's a pretty convenient language to write up those things.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:41.400
That's pretty much the de facto one there for sure.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:47.040
When I took the couple of computer science classes that I did or programming classes,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.680
it was a little bit out of sync with what I was wanting to do.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.920
So I also started out in engineering.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.080
I'm like, maybe I'll switch to something else.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.720
Before I did, they said, well, you're going to need to take a programming class.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.880
I'm like, oh, that sounds awesome.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.120
They're like, yeah, we've got to have Fortran 77 class.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.880
I'm like, are you serious?

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.400
This is the most important class you're ever going to take.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.400
Don't skip on it.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400
I'm like, maybe.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.400
I'm not so sure about that.

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.720
Then I wanted to take another course.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.640
I'm like, maybe I'll take a C++ course.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.880
They're like, great, but first you've got to take a Lisp course.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.080
I'm like, oh boy, really?

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.480
Can I just take something that modern software is built with?

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.480
Please?

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.480
Nope, nope, nope.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.520
But yeah, very fun.

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.040
Quite the journey though, it sounds like.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.040
Knowing Java is a good skill.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:35.280
It's kind of a different paradigm for how code executes.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.280
Same for C, right?

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.200
- Yeah, I definitely think it was helpful.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.000
I think at the time in class, I was like, man, I really love Python.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.760
Why can't we be writing Python?

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.080
But definitely great to get exposure to different languages.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:51.440
I think it helps to better understand general patterns in programming, et cetera, if you

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.280
have to implement that and see the different implementations in different languages.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:56.280
- Yeah, for sure.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.920
Python, with its types, is getting a little bit more like Java, but hopefully not too

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.440
much like Java.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.640
- Yeah.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.840
- Excellent.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.920
All right, so you mentioned that you're doing a lot of Java.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:10.720
Quick audience question out there.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.920
Our student says, "I'm an IT professional.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.720
I've not had any experience in any coding.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.320
What's the best way to start with Python?

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.960
I initially, a few years ago, started learning Java, but kind of lost interest."

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.000
What are your thoughts?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
- That's a great question.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.960
Honestly, I started by reading a how to write Python book and kind of pivoted from that

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.480
to online courses.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.600
I think my number one recommendation would be online courses.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.160
I know you guys at Talk Python have some awesome online courses that people can take.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.600
Before I think in middle school and high school, I took some courses through edX and Udemy.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.720
I think that's a great way to get started because you can kind of have the balance of

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.720
I'm writing code, I'm seeing other people write code.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.080
Often there's auto-graded questions involved.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.760
The nice thing about an online course is that it's asynchronous, right?

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.640
So you can do things when it fits into your own time.

00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:11.400
Another nice thing is that there's a pretty large community of people online who love

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.560
to write Python and are getting started writing Python.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.760
So I think there's also a lot of support there, which is great.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:22.800
- Yeah, there's definitely more resources now than there ever have been, right?

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.800
- Yeah.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.280
I agree with online courses.

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:32.080
I really, really like the focus.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.200
When I started doing the online courses that we have, one of the things I wanted to do

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:41.000
was try to go, how do people who might otherwise take a semester-long course at, say, a community

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.760
college, because if you're in a full-on university, you probably have a program you're following,

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.320
but if you're just like, "I'm just going to take a course," how do you take that and change

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:57.480
that from 16 weeks to five hours and still get something meaningful out of it?

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.040
Since this is kind of focused at young people and not...

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:08.280
We're talking like 20s type of young person, but just if people come along like, "But what

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.480
about my middle school or something?"

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.240
Are you familiar with this project, Code Combat?

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.240
Have you seen this?

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.240
- Yeah.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.240
Yeah, I used it in middle school.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.240
- Did you?

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:19.240
- Yeah.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.240
- Amazing.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.240
What a cool way to write code.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.240
Tell people what it is.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.600
What are your thoughts since you actually used it?

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:32.160
- Yeah, so there are a lot of sites like this that basically allow you to write code with

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:39.440
some pretty significant guidance and support to move along characters in games and help,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.680
in this case, write other characters with your code.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.840
I can think of other examples.

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:49.000
I worked on a robot program where I was helping a robot, Carol, walk around a maze and things

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.320
like that.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:57.240
I think websites like Code Combat or Codecademy or even code.org have a lot of really great

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:02.080
opportunities, especially geared towards younger people who might need help writing code for

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.480
the first time and can't just jump right into the deep end with one of the more complex

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.480
courses on...

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.320
Udemy, for example, offers a lot of more collegiate level things.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.920
But I think these sites are particularly great and entertaining.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.400
It makes you feel like you're playing a game, but you're also learning in the background,

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.400
which is great.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.520
- Yeah, this is such a neat game.

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.160
They've got these different worlds or whatever, and they each have...

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:31.280
This one here, Cloud Drip Mountain, has 110 programming puzzles.

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.280
And the reason I really...

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:38.280
When people ask sometimes, I recommend this one, is a lot of these things that are for

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:44.960
really true younger people or really just true beginners, they hide so much of the code.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.080
They're like, "Well, if we could just teach the concept of loops," and then you just drag

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:52.240
a circle around this thing, and then you click this block in.

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.560
I think that still is a pretty big gap.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.560
But this is...

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.840
You write real Python with an editor, but the little editor is the world's most aggressive

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.360
autocomplete you've ever seen.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.440
If you type the letter H, it'll be like, "Hero.attack."

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.880
And you're like, "What should you type in here?"

00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.320
It's like, "Whoa, okay."

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:14.960
But yeah, I think this is really awesome for young people.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.000
I think even maybe older people might just...

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.960
If they want to play an online game, if you're sitting around, you're like, "Oh, maybe I'll

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:25.160
play Candy Crush or something," I'd rather play Code Combat than that.

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.160
- Yeah.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.520
It's definitely great to have the additional engagement there.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:33.320
And if it's just like, "Write this for loop to do whatever," that's not even close to

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.720
as engaging as the enemy or things like that.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.720
- Yeah, exactly.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.720
Exactly.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.720
Cool.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.720
So I think there are a lot of...

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.640
There's a whole spectrum of online resources there.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.840
All right, how about we jump into some of the tips, some of the things that...

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:53.640
Oh, before we do, one thing, I think you kind of hinted at that with your answer here, your

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.680
response there.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.840
How much programming experience did you have when you got to Madison?

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:08.040
Because I think one of the challenges is, you know, while maybe the principle of computer

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:13.080
science is you could show up with zero coding experience, and they're like, "This is a keyboard.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.400
This is awesome, and we're going to start with that," a lot of people don't.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.760
And so you might be sitting next to somebody like, "Oh, we're both working on a project."

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:20.760
How are you done?

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:24.720
Like, "Well, I've been coding for, you know, however long," right?

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.280
What was your experience going in?

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.280
- Yeah.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:32.560
I would say for a college freshman that I did have quite a bit of experience.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:38.640
I had done all these Code Combat-esque things in middle school, and then I was lucky enough

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:44.880
that my high school offered some coding classes, even at the AP level, so more advanced courses.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.240
So I'd taken those, and then especially over the...

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.240
- Probably more Java, right?

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.000
That's what seems to be a lot.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.000
- Yeah.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.640
I think I actually took one in Python, but I think that there was definitely another

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.920
one in Java.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.640
And then, especially during the pandemic, I did start to get a bit antsy, and I was

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.560
like, "Man, I really want to be, you know, working and applying this."

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:08.640
So I started having computer science internships in high school.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:13.400
So I think definitely coming in, I was a bit more prepared for some of the classes, especially

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.640
my first Java class.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.920
I'd never written Java before, but I at least understood, you know, some of the paradigms

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.400
that were helpful.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.840
And I do think it's helpful to come in with some experience, because like you said, if

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.320
you come in with none, it's a little bit hard to just jump into a college-level course.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.080
- Yeah, for sure.

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:30.080
You can do it.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.080
I'm not saying you can't do it.

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.080
- Yeah.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.080
Yeah.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.200
- So if you look around the class, you're like, "There's some people that are really

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.200
good at this."

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.560
Like maybe that probably is true, but it also could be that there's some people that have

00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.120
a lot of experience and you're brand new.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:47.160
And we all know that the first bit of code that you write is always a bit of a, "Got

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:49.160
to get your mind into it," sort of thing.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.160
- Yeah, definitely.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.100
And I think the good news is too, you know, if you take one quick course, like even introduce

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.800
yourself for, you know, five to 10 hours, like that's going to be a really big benefit.

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:02.640
So it doesn't take a ton of work to just get over that initial, you know, learning curve.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.360
- Yeah, that's a super good point.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:09.200
I remember when I was learning C++, I was so psyched that I got it to compile.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.120
And then I learned about runtime bugs and how much harder they are.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.240
I'm like, "Oh, this is worse.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.240
This is way worse."

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.240
All right.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.520
So, all right.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.120
Let's jump into the tips.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.720
So tip number one you have, work on open source contributions.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:26.960
Tell us about this.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:33.040
- Yeah, so I can't say that during my first couple of years of programming experience

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.040
that I did this.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.680
It was really only more recently, like this past summer.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.280
But I think that, you know, getting involved in the open source community can be really

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:47.680
beneficial, especially in terms of like seeing other well-written code and, you know, standards

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.680
in the industry.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:53.440
And I think, you know, another thing I want to mention here is that like open source contributions

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.160
seem a little bit intimidating at first, right?

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.840
It's like, "Oh my gosh, here's this huge project that has, you know, been worked on for years.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.840
I don't know where to start."

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.480
But like even minor documentation updates are super helpful.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.840
You know, or just writing an example in the docs or writing an extra test, things like

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.840
that.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.840
And so I think even just those little like micro contributions can really help you get

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:18.320
involved in that community and then also just learning more about the tools you're using

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.920
day to day anyways.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.120
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:26.120
And many projects are very welcoming.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.160
People who want to raise their hand and get involved, right?

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.160
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.120
I mean, you know, filtering on the good first issue tag is always a good way to start.

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.680
We're trying to, you know, mark more and more of those at Pydantic just because there are

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.540
certainly a lot of people that want to help and we more than welcome their assistance.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:47.920
It's really great to see, you know, first time contributors popping up every day.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:53.080
- So for people who maybe are listening and they're thinking about just getting into this,

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:54.080
right?

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:59.900
But I'm gonna label it good first issue, right?

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:09.720
So if you go to the issues, you can actually see here, which things have been labeled as,

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.520
look, you don't need to understand a whole bunch about this system to get started.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:19.560
So that's a really good way to kind of see what's already out there because I think you

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.160
might look at a project, I want to help, but how?

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.280
Like, what do they need help with?

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:28.640
Like, well, here's a whole list of small steps that people, somebody could raise their hand

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.640
and help with, right?

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.640
- Right, exactly.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:33.560
Yeah, it's a great, you know, when you have this huge project, it's like, oh no, where

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:34.560
do I even start?

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.880
And then searching by that tag is a great way to just jump in and filter, especially,

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:42.760
you know, on large projects like we currently have about 400 issues, right?

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.720
So it's nice to have that filter there.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.920
- Honestly, I'm pretty impressed that there's only 400 issues.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.000
- Yeah, I'm trying to keep it clean, we'll see.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
- It's not easy, is it?

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.440
- No, definitely a lot coming in, a lot coming in after every release, but it's great to,

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.400
you know, see so many people engaging and interested in new features and helping report

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.120
and fix bugs, you know?

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.120
- Yeah, yeah.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:09.200
And I'm looking here and one of these, it's just the open ones, but it's numbered 8,058.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:16.520
So, you know, that's a whole bunch of closed or deleted, ignored issues, but somebody had

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.400
to deal with them along the way, yeah?

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.400
- Yeah, certainly.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:23.680
And I think another great thing about working on open source contributions, especially if

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:27.880
you don't have a ton of experience with software development, you know, maybe you're a student

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.200
and you've worked a lot with computer science concepts, is it's a great way to practice

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.760
your version control skills, right?

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.840
Like you're gonna need to make commits, you're gonna need to submit a pull request and get

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.960
that reviewed and iterate with other developers.

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:46.000
And so it's an awesome way to just pick a project and develop those skills kind of in

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.360
parallel with your actual coding skills as well.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.840
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:55.280
And also get a sense of what does releasing and testing software feel like, because you've

00:22:55.280 --> 00:23:00.400
probably got a PR, then the PR has got to run some continuous integration, and then,

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.920
you know, which branch does it go into?

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:08.600
All those sort of things that we were talking about before that make it hard to simulate

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:13.640
in school, like you throw it in the somewhat deep end, but, you know, it's good learning.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.640
- Yep, definitely.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.320
And there's a lot of documentation to help with, you know, how do I make my first commit?

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.360
How do I pull this code down, et cetera, which is good.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.360
- Yeah.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.560
I also think the tutorials and the documentation side could be really helpful.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:33.080
I was working on some project and it had documentation for the, you know, whatever property function,

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.760
whatever it was that I was working with, some kind of enumeration.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.000
And it was like split segments.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.160
And then you look at it, the documentation says, this, setting this to true will split

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.160
the segments.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.480
Like, okay, what does it base the splitting on?

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.480
What does this even do?

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.480
Like, okay, I understand they will be split, but I would need to be more precise, right?

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:58.600
And like, just, if you look at it, it kind of has just the name turned into a sentence,

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:03.400
like, you know, that thing is ripe for getting a little bit of extra detail, I would say.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.400
- Yeah, definitely.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:09.360
You know, if you're confused, I'm sure someone else is confused and always great to at least,

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.560
you know, report or help fix that, et cetera.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:12.560
- Yeah.

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:21.120
The other thing I like about your first tip here is you make connections in the industry

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.400
pretty quickly, right?

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:26.520
Like jumping into Pydanic, you get to know Samuel Colvin, who's connected to all these

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:27.520
other people.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.560
And you probably work with Sebastian Ramirez from FastAPI because those two projects work

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:32.560
closely together, right?

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.400
And all of a sudden people are like, "Oh yeah, that guy's amazing.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.400
I wish I could meet him."

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.520
You know, you're working, you know, virtually side by side, right?

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.520
- Yeah.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:47.160
Yeah, it's really great and, you know, awesome to have such a community that's focused on

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.600
like helping other projects.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.440
And obviously it's just, you know, general improvement of projects for public use, which

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.800
is a really great motive.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.640
And as you mentioned, like any contribution that you're going to make is going to get

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:02.400
you noticed and help you make connections, which is great when you're, for example, a

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.680
student like me looking to, you know, like make connections in the computer science and

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.280
software community and maybe look for jobs eventually, et cetera.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.280
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:17.720
And if people show up, you know, you go to a job interview and there's 10, 20 applicants

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.520
and they're like, "Okay, look, we work with FastAPI.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.200
Have you, are you familiar with it?"

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.560
Somebody says, "No, I think I've heard of it.

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:25.800
Is that a Python framework?"

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.800
"Yes, it's a Python framework."

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.800
"Okay."

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.800
Then the next person is like, "Yeah, I've written a little demo app with it."

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.680
And then, you know, you show up and you're like, "Yeah, I actually contributed and added

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.280
this feature that I hired."

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:37.280
You know what I mean?

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.280
- Right, totally.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.880
Yeah, it's, you know, I think, you know, a lot of people focus on what does your, you

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:45.040
know, kind of GitHub profile look like?

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.040
What kind of projects do you have, et cetera?

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.600
And, you know, if you're like, "Man, I don't have the time to develop all these awesome

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:56.520
projects on my own, but you know how I can boost my profiles, just work on other people's

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.480
projects, help out," et cetera.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.480
- Right.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.680
- You know, someday you'll probably come up with something that catches on and you'll

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.680
have your own project.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:10.160
But, you know, when you're really new, it's kind of hard to...those things are not easy

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.320
to make a popular project in the first place.

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:15.680
And so, you can really jumpstart that whole process.

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:17.280
- Yep, definitely.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:21.880
- All right, related to this, and you kind of hinted that it is the next tip is reading

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.560
other people's code.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.560
- Yeah.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:30.200
- Yeah, so I think, as we discussed at the beginning of the podcast, sometimes the code

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:33.560
that you might write in class, you perhaps are a little bit more focused on, you know,

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:38.000
getting it to work than how clean is this, how maintainable is this, how well would it

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.040
work with other systems.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.200
And so, I think reading other people's code, especially often through, you know, open-source

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.240
contributions can be really beneficial in just helping you understand, like, what are

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.640
the industry norms?

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:53.320
How can I improve my own code so that I'm, you know, matching these?

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.840
And another great kind of tie-in with the open-source contributions is if I write some

00:26:57.840 --> 00:27:03.640
code to fix a bug and then get reviews from the, you know, maintainers of a repository,

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.600
like, I'm getting immediate feedback about, like, how am I doing in my, you know, patterns

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.040
that I'm using and the ways that I'm refactoring things, et cetera.

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.680
And I think that's one of the best ways to learn the most quickly is, you know, you already

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.600
had to come up with a solution to implement this fix yourself, but then let me, you know,

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.720
collaborate with other people who are really experienced in this field to get a better

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.440
idea of how I should be solving problems like this.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.440
Sure.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:37.360
And when you learn through a tutorial or online course or even a college course, there's really

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.680
different kind of expectations about how the code runs a lot of times.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.320
It's like, oh, okay, so if I type this in and I do this loop and I do this thing, then

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:46.960
it'll work.

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.640
But what about the error handling?

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:50.080
What about the robustness?

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.080
Right?

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:57.440
Like, those things are my experience when I was working with interns more quite a while

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:02.680
ago, but it was like, we'd have a project, project would be going along great and they'd

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.600
write awesome code, but I'd say, okay, see where you're supposed to put that number,

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.000
type the word seven in there and see what happens, you know, and then, poof, the program

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
dies.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.280
You're like, okay, we still got a little more work to do.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.800
But how about an error message, like this has to be a number rather than just killing

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.800
the program.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.800
Right?

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:25.360
Those kinds of things you learn by working on real projects like open source ones, I

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:26.360
think.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.360
Yeah, definitely.

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.600
And I think also, you get to better understand for a given language, obviously I'm most familiar

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.520
with Python, like where should I be writing documentation for my code?

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.040
Where should I be putting my examples?

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.920
Where should I put my tests?

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.400
And things like that you don't necessarily have to think about if you're just writing

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:48.120
a script for a class or online or in person, whatever that might be.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.120
Yeah.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:54.840
William out there says, when wanting to contribute to a project, I tend to fall down the try

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.880
to understand everything rabbit hole.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:00.440
Any tips on balancing contributing and learning by reading code?

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.040
Yeah, that's a great question.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.440
I definitely fell down that rabbit hole myself.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:08.160
I'm like, okay, I'm going to fix this one line in this function and then I'm like, oh,

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.400
I just read 500 lines of code in this file.

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:18.240
So I think a good thing is to focus specifically on one issue, right?

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:23.800
Like find one bug or one fix that needs to be made and just kind of constrain yourself

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.480
to like, let me fix this one thing.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.320
And then if you're like, oh, I have extra time, then go ahead and read the rest.

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:35.240
But I think, obviously to your point, you do have to contextualize some to be able to

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.320
understand an issue or a bug better.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.360
But I suppose the nice thing is the more you read, the better.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.680
It ends up being the longterm.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.680
Yeah.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:50.960
Personally, I kind of feel like try to understand programs and stuff like vertical slices through

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.560
like all the tiers and parts of it.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.320
Like how much of this database bit do I need to understand to make this part work?

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.000
I don't want to try to understand all the stored procedures and this weird optimization.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.240
I just need to know, how do I get this thing so that I can do this feature?

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:12.780
You kind of slowly explore your way through, but you can sort of do those things more quickly

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.880
than trying to like, okay, first we're going to read everything.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880
Right.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.880
Give me a week.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.880
Yeah.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:22.240
And I think another thing that helps sometimes that helps keep me focused is, okay, let me

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.280
create something that's going to reproduce this problem and then let me step through

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:32.160
a debugger so that I'm at least letting myself know where this data is coming from or where

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.360
this problem is coming from.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.920
But I don't necessarily have to understand every function that things move through or

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:41.560
every class, but I'm at least getting that kind of higher level understanding of where

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.960
the heck is this thing coming from?

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:47.800
And then I can really focus more on where's the issue that needs to be fixed and let me

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.840
really take a look at those couple of lines of code.

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.840
Yeah.

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:55.520
I think another thing you get from reading other people's code is an appreciation of

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.320
style, right?

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:03.600
Like formatting and polish and presentation, because a lot of the open source code is a

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.600
lot of good code.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:09.560
And a lot of times this is open source code is written to be read more than it's meant

00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:10.560
to be written.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:11.560
Right.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.560
Yeah, definitely.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:17.100
We, you know, like our automatic formatters a lot at Pydantic.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:24.180
So we just implemented the new Ruff formatter, which is written in Rust super fast and adheres

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:29.740
to, I think it's like 99.9% compatible with black, which is great.

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.000
And then before that we were using black for everything.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.060
So another benefit of those contributions is getting used to using code formatters,

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:38.420
you know, once you're done writing your code.

00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:42.780
And now I find myself, you know, just creating an environment and using code formatters for

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:47.660
my academic code anyways, because I can't stand the look of it if it doesn't match.

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:48.660
Yeah.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.660
The professors must love you.

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:52.100
They're like, "Oh, this is so nice.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.180
I can read it compared to like whatever."

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.580
So yeah, the other one that got submitted.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.580
Yeah.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:03.420
I switched over to using rough for all of my projects as well and ran rough against

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.380
like tens of thousands of lines of Python and Ruff format.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:10.580
And it was like, you hit enter and it's just done.

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:16.060
It's like reformatted, you know, 392 Python files.

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.380
Did it really do it that quick?

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.380
Yeah.

00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:22.340
I think Sebastian was quoted as saying like, you know, sometimes I purposely introduce

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:27.100
little bugs or, you know, well formatted things in my code just to make sure it's working.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.900
And it is, but I just wanted to make sure because it's so darn fast.

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:30.900
Yeah.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:32.900
That's awesome.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.820
I integrated it into PyCharm and there's a way now with the plugin to say when you do

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:41.540
reformat code in PyCharm, just run Ruff format, which is really cool.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:45.140
And so now you just, you know, hit the keystroke to reformat and it's just, you go, and you're

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.420
like, okay, now it's all good to go.

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:48.420
Very nice.

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.420
Awesome.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:53.460
I know what I'll be doing after this call then.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:57.020
Alyssa says, "I'm a TA for a college intro Python course.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:33:00.860
What advice would you have for students getting into Python for the first time in college

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:01.860
level?

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:03.860
You know, what to focus their time on and so on."

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:05.860
Yeah, that's a great question.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:10.580
I think kind of the fundamental data structures can be really helpful to focus on at first

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:16.540
and kind of fundamental concepts to programming like for loops, while loops, functions, classes,

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:17.540
et cetera.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:23.780
And one nice thing about Python is that, you know, it's relatively easy to read code that's

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.060
written with those structures, right?

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:30.460
Like it's a little bit more intuitive than other languages like C for example.

00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:34.660
And so I think getting started with those basics is nice in Python because if you just

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:39.220
look at someone's example code who's implemented that, you can kind of read it like English

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.940
if it's written well enough.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:46.020
Good games for variables and functions and that kind of stuff, right?

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:47.020
Yeah, definitely.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:51.300
And I think too, kind of like we mentioned at the beginning, if you kind of find a fun,

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.700
easy project that can help to contextualize and make your work more exciting, right?

00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:00.100
If it's not just, okay, let me think through these 10 concepts that I need to learn, but

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:06.340
like, oh, let me write a rock, paper, scissors function or, you know, things like that.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.700
Yeah.

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:13.620
One thing I'd also throw in there to add is maybe get them started with good tools really

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.100
soon, right?

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:21.500
Like PyCharm or VS Code, something like that, like rather than just notepad or some random

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:24.420
thing like, look, these tools will really, really help you.

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:26.420
They'll like help auto format it.

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.500
They'll like do the formatting for you.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:32.820
They'll give you advice and show you the errors before you even run it, you know, like send

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.380
them on the right path with that.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:36.460
Yeah, that's a great tip.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.100
I think it makes everything feel a little bit less overwhelming, right?

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:43.380
It's like, okay, this is going to do half my work for me and then I just need to do

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.380
some of the thinking.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.380
Exactly.

00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:46.380
And it's got my back.

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:49.460
I think, you know, if you say like, okay, you type the if statement, then you hit colon,

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:50.660
then you go and you hit four spaces.

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:51.660
You're like, what?

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:52.660
I got to press space four times.

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:56.420
This is, what if you just say I type colon, I hit enter, then I keep typing and it's like

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.420
auto indented.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.780
I think it's already done what I need.

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:03.220
Then like, oh, okay, this is actually, it sounds weird, but it's actually totally fine.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.420
Yeah.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:11.580
So your next piece of advice here is to join some kind of club, like computer science club

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:15.020
or something at your school to get going.

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.060
Yeah.

00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:20.300
So like I mentioned, I was really fortunate in high school to have, you know, a teacher

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:26.180
that taught some CS courses and I even helped lead like the coding club at my school.

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:31.660
And I think this is a really great opportunity to engage with other students who are interested

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:32.660
in coding.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.140
Even if you don't have coding courses, you can, you know, all kind of get together once

00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:41.740
a week even, or once every two weeks and just work on projects or learn together in the

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:42.740
club that I was leading.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:48.780
We sort of did a combination of little lessons and then also, you know, working on projects

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.280
together.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.500
And then sometimes we would do little competitions.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.900
You know, there are things like LeetCode and other websites like that, that allow you to

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.860
practice your algorithm skills.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:05.120
And not only are you getting better with coding, but it also helps to connect with other coders

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.120
in your community.

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.140
I think obviously by the nature of the work, sometimes it can feel a little bit lonely.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.740
And so it's nice to connect like that.

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:16.740
And if you're not in school, but still looking to engage, there are, you know, Python meetups

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:21.740
and other like data meetups and yeah, yeah, exactly.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:29.340
I don't know why I chose this location, but yeah, I just threw Python.

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.940
I told it near you, but it actually put it in Verizon New York or whatever.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:34.780
There's tons and tons of these places, right?

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:39.380
An evening of Python coding, Python and APIs, Python, a hundred days of code.

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:42.580
There's just tons of options, right?

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:46.620
Because when you're in school, there's usually like clubs either in high school or in college,

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:48.540
maybe even more.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.740
But once you graduate, then you're like, well, I can't go back to high school.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:53.740
That'd be weird.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:37:05.700
So, but these, these meetups and also, you know, PyCon just got announced for Pittsburgh

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.700
and PyCon is such a major experience, I think for a lot of people.

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:14.980
Looking in from the outside, I feel like people, a lot of people were like, well, I was really

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:15.980
intimidated to go.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:20.420
And really it's just like a programming party and everyone's so welcoming and you should

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.980
really check it out, I think for people listening.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:23.980
I'm excited.

00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:26.540
I'm going to go for the first time in next year.

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:27.540
Yeah.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:29.540
Awesome.

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.540
Yeah.

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.540
I love PyCon.

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.100
Always, always tons of fun.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.620
Let's see.

00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:39.140
What's our next tip here?

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.460
Reach out to local companies for job opportunities.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:45.140
You talked about your internships and I was going to ask you about like, how did you find

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:46.140
them?

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.540
So soon, but I knew the tip was coming, so save it for now.

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.940
Like this is a great, great piece of advice.

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:52.940
Yeah.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:58.020
So I think sometimes getting a, you know, your first job in a computer science field

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:01.740
can, or, you know, software development field can feel a little bit intimidating, especially

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.860
when you're on the younger side.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:03.860
Right.

00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.580
It's like, oh, well all these people that I see working at thing companies are older

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:13.100
and have degrees and are more experienced, but you know, there are a lot of small computer

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:18.260
science startups or even medium sized companies that are more than happy to hire younger,

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:21.020
you know, high school interns.

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:27.580
And so my first ever like computer science experience was at a company that was in Chapel

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:31.860
Hill, Carver, where I grew up called QuantWorks and I worked for them for two summers in a

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:35.940
row and it was really great just to start to get working with other people.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:44.820
We did some work for a local nonprofit group and then worked on an API with COVID information.

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:49.740
And you know, even those, these weren't like huge projects you'd hear about at Google or

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:50.740
things like that.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:55.380
It was really great to just get those like local experiences.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:59.140
And I think also it's a little bit easier to, you know, get ins at smaller companies,

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:00.140
right?

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:05.460
Like if I, as a 15 year old email someone at Google, like, you know, who knows about

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.580
me hearing a response, but you know, local companies, I think it's just a lot easier

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:14.300
to connect and start growing your career roots there.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.300
Yeah.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.780
Here's the big secret that you don't learn until you've kind of walked the path.

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:25.300
I think if you get one of those jobs at the amazing Fang companies or some big tech company,

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:29.220
you're probably going to be doing something really focused and specific.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:34.020
You won't get a real broad chance to work on software, but if you get a job at a small

00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:38.540
company, you know, you kind of got to do a lot of stuff because, well, it's maybe you

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.860
and the one other person.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.580
So I think it helps you grow a little bit quicker.

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:47.460
Yeah, I completely agree.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:54.700
I've been really grateful to have had kind of all my job experiences be at smaller companies.

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:58.420
At the next company that I worked at, it was an insurance tech company.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:05.540
I got to work on an API client and on even some like marketing videos for our company

00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:13.380
and then got my first exposure to cloud infrastructure, which like you're saying, those combinations

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:17.300
of things aren't something you'd get to do at a large company internship.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.940
So I think that's one of the benefits of-

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.260
Yeah, there's teams for each one of those things you just said.

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:22.260
Right.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:24.100
And then sub teams and then sub sub teams.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.100
Yes, exactly.

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.420
And it's easier, like you said, it's easier to get those jobs.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:32.780
So it'd be cool to get a job at Google or Microsoft or whatever, but seriously, look

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:33.780
around.

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:39.580
There's probably a lot more opportunity at small groups that really need some computer

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:40.580
help.

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:41.580
You know what I mean?

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:42.580
Yeah.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.420
And the benefits of looking local is like you might already have a connection there

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.120
that you didn't know about or like that.

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:50.860
So it's always helpful.

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:54.300
Next up, next tip, learn about software design principles.

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:58.740
Yeah, so this kind of ties nicely into our previous tip.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:04.800
But I think the earlier you get to start working on some sort of production system or even

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:08.380
just an open source project that has releases, etc.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:13.020
The earlier you get to start learning about how do I integrate and deploy this and how

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:18.540
do I work with pipelines and why are all my tests failing and things like that.

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:24.580
And I think having those skills going into other opportunities really makes employers

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:29.060
excited because you're already experienced in things like that.

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:32.780
And so they don't have to spend the first couple of weeks getting used to their integration

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:37.280
and deployment systems and contributing to the repository and pull requests and things

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.100
like that.

00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:42.080
And even things like agile development strategies.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:46.420
So getting used to like, how do I plan out what I'm going to develop in the next two

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:47.420
weeks?

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:51.060
Obviously, there are various different systems you can use for that.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:56.460
But I think just taking things one step further from I know how to write the code to like,

00:41:56.460 --> 00:42:02.880
how do I write the code with a team and how do I make sure it's released consistently

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:05.380
and reliably, etc. can be really beneficial.

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.380
Yeah, you mentioned the team.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:11.980
Circling back just really quickly, like both to the contributing to open source and the

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.980
join in club.

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.620
I think when a lot of people first think about programming, they think about, you know, okay,

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:20.140
well, I'm going to go into the basement and shut the blinds and not see anyone and just

00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:24.140
write code and become pale.

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.660
But a lot of software actually is a pretty social, pretty interactive experience.

00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:33.060
I think you get both of those from open source and internships and the clubs as well.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.060
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.060
Yeah.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:37.060
And it's more fun.

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.060
Come on.

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.060
Certainly.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.060
Yeah.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.300
Speaking of fun, find an opportunity to teach code.

00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:47.220
Yeah, so this one, I think is a little bit harder to orchestrate.

00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:54.080
But obviously, there are always people wanting to learn how to code and people of all ages

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.720
learning wanting to learn how to code.

00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:02.200
So kind of my own experience was this with this was in high school, my school was promoting

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:07.620
this class for anyone of all ages, it was gonna happen, you know, from seven to 9pm

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:10.900
once a week, and we're going to teach Apple Swift.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:14.780
So that like app development programming language, and I had only, you know, learned it for a

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:17.740
couple of weeks, but they were looking for volunteers to help teach.

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:23.460
And, you know, it's similar to think our viewer, Alyssa mentioned, she's a TA, right.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:28.780
And I think the more you teach something, the more you are able to, you know, convince

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:31.900
yourself that you understand it and really grasp concepts.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:35.980
And so I think if you get an opportunity to teach, you know, even if it's just volunteering,

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:40.620
or if it's paid, it's really beneficial in helping you understand those concepts.

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:44.180
And I think just sparking kind of a general love for the community, right, like when you

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:47.220
get to help others learn, that's really positive experience.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.300
Yeah, it's it is pretty amazing.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:55.020
And it doesn't have to be a full on college course, it could be, you know, we talked about

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:59.900
the meetups or clubs, like, hey, I'm going to volunteer to do a presentation at one of

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:00.900
the local meetups.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:02.780
Yeah, that's people are pretty supportive.

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.820
And it's pretty, pretty low key.

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:08.680
And some of the ones I've been to will be like, well, we're gonna have three presenters

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:12.980
and they're each, you know, 20 minutes instead of one person who has to be up there in front

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:17.100
for like a really long time and a 20 minute presentation on something that you're kind

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.100
of passionate about.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:21.780
It's pretty easy once you if you if you're worried, you know, once you get over being

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.860
nervous, it's pretty easy.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:24.860
Definitely.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.620
And, you know, it's like, okay, what code did you write last week?

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.300
And what tool did you find really helpful?

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.460
Like, it's pretty easy to talk about that in front of other people who are also going

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.420
to be really excited to learn about it.

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:35.700
I thought this would be easy.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:36.700
It was really hard.

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:37.700
Here's what I did.

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:40.500
Here's how we made it like got through and what actually unlocked it.

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.700
And like that kind of stuff is really fun to talk about and super helpful.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.700
Yeah.

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:53.340
You know, one of your other pieces of advice that they get kind of leans into the internship

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.780
side of things, you know, connect with nonprofits and see if you can help with any of their

00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:57.780
needs.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:44:58.780
Yeah.

00:44:58.780 --> 00:45:01.900
So we've talked a lot about community on this podcast, right?

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:05.740
I think the more you involved with open source projects and, you know, work at a company,

00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:10.900
you start to realize, okay, this like really is a, you know, welcoming and engaged community

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:15.940
and kind of taking that outside of the sphere of just computer science.

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:20.580
Obviously, nonprofits really help to, you know, do great things for communities.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:25.980
And often they have some pretty significant tech needs that are hard to meet.

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:31.260
And so I think another really great opportunity for young people who aren't maybe necessarily

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:36.300
ready to start like a full time job or even part time job is just, can I work for a couple

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.860
of hours a week with this, you know, nonprofit to help them that might be, can I help them

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.060
maintain their website?

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:46.780
Or can I, you know, build them a spreadsheet that has a couple of automations that's really

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.900
going to help them.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:53.540
So like one example is that in Chapel Hill where I'm from, we have this great nonprofit

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:59.140
called Porch that helps collect food from neighbors porches and then redistributes that

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:02.560
to local families in need and food pantries.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:06.780
And you can imagine once you, you know, start to hear about this organization and it spreads,

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.380
there's a lot of people involved.

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:14.140
And so I helped my first internship kind of build a tool for them just to like organize

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:17.340
their routes for pickups and things like that.

00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:19.540
And so it doesn't even have to be as complicated as that.

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:23.900
But just I think reaching out to nonprofits is a great way to not only feel like great,

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:27.340
I have a coding community, but also like I have a place in my broader community as a

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.340
whole.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:29.340
Yeah.

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:34.220
And also offer some nice, nice ways to give back.

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:37.980
If you're working on a project where you, you know, maybe you're enjoying writing the

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:40.980
code, but you're not like, well, how much am I contributing?

00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:45.340
Like I'm trying to, you know, optimize the trading speed for this algorithm.

00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:50.940
Like that's cool and all, but I kind of want to just feel like I'm using some of my powers

00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:51.940
for good.

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:55.540
You know, one of these things that comes to mind is just this thing called the humanitarian

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:57.420
toolbox.

00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:01.540
And it's a whole bunch of different pieces of software to help like when there's earthquakes

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:08.660
or other national tsunami type disasters and, you know, helping humanitarian organizations

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.860
solve technology problems with open source, right.

00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.140
Things like that is just, that's pretty cool.

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.140
Yeah.

00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:17.900
So people can, I mean, this is just one that I know of.

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:22.660
You can search around and find, I'm sure there's many of these projects and if there's not,

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.860
you know, you could create one like the project you just talked about.

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:26.860
Right.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:27.860
Yeah.

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:29.860
Definitely.

00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:30.860
It's exciting that the need is always there.

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:34.700
And so if you just find a project that sparks interest in you, like go ahead and contribute.

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:35.700
Yeah, absolutely.

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:36.700
All right.

00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:39.540
What do we got next here?

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:41.180
Sign up for a couple of newsletters.

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:42.180
Yeah.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:46.020
So this is a pretty like easy and passive way to get better at things.

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:50.620
But you know, if you just sign up for a couple of newsletters, I know like real Python has

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:55.020
a great one that just sends out little tidbits and tricks and, you know, best practices and

00:47:55.020 --> 00:48:01.180
then kind of a more career focused one is Ryan Peterman has a newsletter about just

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:06.260
kind of advancing through a software development oriented career.

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:09.820
You know, when you're sitting on the bus or ready to go to bed and just want to take a

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:13.940
little read of something, it's nice to just spend, you know, two to five minutes reading

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:16.460
little hints and tips and tricks.

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:20.840
And this is a nice thing for people who are quite busy and still looking to improve, but

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:25.180
don't have a ton of time to, you know, add an additional course or teach a class or go

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:27.140
to a meetup, things like that.

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:29.540
Yeah, absolutely.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.460
Another tip you have is take online courses.

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:32.460
Yeah.

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:33.900
So they're pretty short, right?

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:34.900
Yeah.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:35.980
Kind of mentioned that already.

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:42.180
But I honestly, another benefit that I found of that is just really helping me feel more

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:44.160
comfortable in class.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:49.780
You know, if I started taking, I think my first like machine learning course when I

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:54.100
was in eighth or ninth grade, and obviously I did not understand a lot of what was going

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:59.300
on in the course, but at least I pulled, you know, maybe 20% out of the course and got

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.300
to move forward with that.

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.780
And so I think just the earlier you get to have exposure to things that you find cool,

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.260
the easier it's going to be to learn down the line.

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.160
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:11.420
Another tip you have is learn more than one language, which you're kind of forced to do

00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:16.060
in computer science programs, but it's easy to just go like, well, I've chose which one

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:17.420
I'm going to learn on my own.

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:19.220
And then I just did that, right?

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:20.220
Yeah, definitely.

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:23.780
I think, you know, especially with Python, a lot of people who get started with maybe

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:27.460
a more data science oriented trajectory are like, okay, this is all I need.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:30.060
I've got everything right here, you know?

00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:35.260
And I think it just makes you a better programmer to have exposure to different languages.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:40.340
And, you know, maybe you don't have a ton of time to study three at once, but like,

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:43.500
go read, you know, some code from a different language.

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:47.940
And I'm kind of experiencing that right now, getting used to writing some code in Pydantic

00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:53.060
core, which is in Rust, and then being a little bit more familiar with the like Pydantic Python

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:54.060
wrapper.

00:49:54.060 --> 00:50:00.060
But it's really refreshing and great to learn about new ways to solve problems.

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.660
And, you know, obviously Rust is quite impressive and fast.

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:04.260
So that's always exciting too.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:05.260
Yeah.

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.260
You can tell that Python's getting older, over 30 years now, because there's a lot of

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:09.260
Rust in it.

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:10.260
Yeah, exactly.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:14.460
No, it really is impressive how much it's gone from, oh, we're just doing everything

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:20.660
in C extensions to like, all the fancy shiny stuff is Rust internal somewhere.

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:21.660
Yep.

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:25.820
You've already talked about multiple tools that are in libraries that are that way.

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:26.820
Right.

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:31.340
And we use Py03, which is an awesome library that kind of helps to connect Python to Rust.

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:35.300
And, you know, there are more and more open source contributions to projects like that

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:39.300
that help link languages, which is awesome.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.540
Yeah.

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:46.980
So one sort of sub tip that you had in here is this, get 1% better every day.

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:48.380
And you'd sort of group that into the newsletters.

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:54.260
But I think that can go kind of shared amongst many of your pieces of advice.

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.460
Yeah.

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:58.380
I think it's a great mindset to have in general.

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:03.420
You know, as long as you're putting in relatively consistent work to learn and practice what

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.740
you're learning, et cetera, I think you'll be quite surprised and impressed with yourself

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:10.860
at how much better you're getting, how much more comfortable you feel with things.

00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:14.340
And I feel like when you're just starting out and you've got this huge learning curve

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:20.500
to work on, it's really great to, you know, just be consistent, like for five to 30 minutes

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.380
a day, like work on this thing.

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.900
And then even in two weeks, you're going to be like, wow, I've learned so much, you know,

00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.620
and then you can imagine what you'll feel like in a year.

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:35.500
Yeah, I think it's so easy to underestimate that how that compounds in your career.

00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:41.060
I remember when I first got my first real programming job, I was still in grad school,

00:51:41.060 --> 00:51:44.460
but working on it a lot.

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:48.620
You would get, you know, officially you got an hour for lunch.

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:51.980
The way it really worked, we'd go grab some food, you know, eat it quick in the little

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:54.740
courtyard and then go back to work.

00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:58.500
And it's because where else are you going to go?

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:03.860
But what I started doing was I would get some new programming book, book on refactoring

00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:07.540
or design patterns, or I was doing C++ at the time, so some C++ book.

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:11.340
And I would just say, look, I get an hour, I got 25 minutes before I go back to work,

00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:14.060
I'm going to just sit here and read the book every day.

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:20.020
And just, you know, one, I felt like I was supposed to have an hour from my job for lunch

00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:22.540
and two, it was contributing back to my work anyway.

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:27.300
But it was after doing that for a year or two, I went from being like a super newbie

00:52:27.300 --> 00:52:31.620
to giving, you know, conference talks to people like, well, how'd you learn all this stuff?

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:34.020
I was like, well, lunch, basically.

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.460
Yeah, totally.

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:39.820
And I mean, kind of connecting back to this podcast, over the summer, I started listening,

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:43.900
you know, I was like, well, I have a 15 minute walk to work each way, I might as well learn

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:44.900
something while I'm at it.

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:46.660
And I'm a big fan of podcasts anyways.

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.500
But, you know, I had finished my New York Times daily by then.

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.460
And I was like, well, I've got to listen to something else.

00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:55.540
So it's great to just, you know, we have so much downtime during our days when we could

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.620
be listening to something.

00:52:56.620 --> 00:53:01.540
But listening to this podcast is another great way to just pick up tips and learn about what's

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:03.300
going on in the Python community.

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:06.500
And you know, how can I write my own code better, things like that.

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:08.460
Yeah, I really appreciate that.

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:09.460
And thanks.

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:14.380
I find that there's a lot of people who will write me and when I first started this podcast,

00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.540
I was like, well, who's going to listen to such a such a show?

00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:18.860
It must be the people like really, really into it.

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:19.860
Right.

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:23.940
And then I started getting emails from people who would say, hey, I really enjoy your show.

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:26.340
I'm starting to understand a lot of the things you're saying.

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.900
I'm like, I've been listening for six weeks.

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:31.260
I'm like, why are you listening for six weeks and you barely understand?

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.620
Well, OK, thank you.

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.260
But why do you do this?

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:38.940
And what I realized is a lot of people who are new start to use it as a language immersion.

00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:42.740
You know, like if you wanted to learn Portuguese, you just go live in Brazil for six months

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:43.740
and then you would know it.

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:44.740
Right.

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:46.060
And so they kind of like, well, I want to be in the Python space.

00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:50.780
So I'm just going to like immerse myself in that space until until it starts to click.

00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:51.780
Yeah.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:53.780
It's a good way to do it.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:58.820
Like for the job that I had this previous summer, I was working in the Django framework.

00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:03.260
And, you know, obviously, when you're on the job and writing code and you have a problem,

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:06.420
it's pretty easy to just look something up and read through documentation, etc.

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:10.260
But then I kind of started searching through your previous podcast and just listening to

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:14.660
episodes about Django because it was like, OK, what can I, you know, pick up that I don't

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:19.660
necessarily need like right now to solve my problem, but can really help me down the line

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:23.300
and just kind of in my day to day writing the code.

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:24.300
Yeah.

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.300
Let's see.

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.940
I think we might have touched on pretty much all of the tips.

00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:33.100
Yeah, I guess the last one is part time freelance work.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.500
So one angle was get an internship and so on.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:38.940
But maybe you live in a place where it's hard.

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:41.580
It's hard to find a remote internship or something like that.

00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:42.580
Right.

00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:46.620
You could do some lightweight consulting type of work.

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:48.100
Yeah, exactly.

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:53.620
So I'm certainly more interested in the back end or like full stack kind of thing.

00:54:53.620 --> 00:54:58.820
But there are a lot of people who are looking for website help and website development.

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:04.820
So I've kind of reached out on platforms like Nextdoor, which is just like a neighborhood

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:09.500
communication platform and through school email lists and things like that and said,

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.100
hey, does anyone need help building a website?

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:14.620
And honestly, I do most things through Wix.

00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:19.620
So it's not like it takes a ton of technical knowledge, like I didn't need to study these

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:23.140
things for years and years to be able to practice them.

00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:26.460
But there are a lot of people looking for just help with technical things.

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:31.540
And if you have little bits of time here and there, but can't commit to a full internship

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:35.940
or full time job or anything like that, it's a great way to just get started writing code.

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:39.380
And people are always super grateful just to have the tech help.

00:55:39.380 --> 00:55:40.380
Absolutely.

00:55:40.380 --> 00:55:43.660
Yeah, it's a good way for you to get experience out there.

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:44.660
All right.

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:52.020
I'll throw one in here to maybe round close things out is volunteer at conferences.

00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:55.500
So we talked about going to conferences or going and joining meetups.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:58.740
But you could volunteer at a conference or at a meetup.

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:04.660
And a lot of these conferences like PyCon, there's hundreds of many, many volunteers.

00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:08.660
I think it probably is over 100 volunteers to make that happen.

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:11.660
And I think there might even be sometimes like travel grants.

00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:16.220
Like if I volunteer to basically work at the conference, will you get me there sort

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:17.660
of thing.

00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:23.380
And much like working open source, it really lets you make connections with people in the

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:24.380
industry, right?

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:25.380
Yeah.

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:26.380
With the speakers and other folks.

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:27.380
Yeah.

00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.380
Yeah, definitely.

00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:30.660
I think that's a really great piece of advice.

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:34.900
I think a lot of these are very applicable to like, even if you don't have a ton of experience,

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:35.900
you can get started with this.

00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:39.700
And it can kind of be your on ramp into this community if that's what you're interested

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:40.700
in.

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:41.780
And I think that's a really great one, right?

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:46.220
Because not only are you going to get to be in this community, but also like no better

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:48.620
place to learn about Python than PyCon, right?

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:53.860
So it's nice to just be in that space and get to absorb that, all that information as

00:56:53.860 --> 00:56:54.860
well.

00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:55.860
Yeah.

00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:59.020
And people might not know, they hear about PyCon, they're like, okay, that's the one,

00:56:59.020 --> 00:57:00.700
that's the big one in the US and it moves around.

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:04.660
And then there's EuroPython, which is in amazing places in Europe.

00:57:04.660 --> 00:57:12.420
But there's actually many, many miniature PyCons around, there's like PyOhio and there's

00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:15.620
PyTennessee and PyTexas and PyCascades.

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:20.260
And I was at PyBay in San Francisco a little while ago, there's a bunch of volunteers there.

00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:24.980
So it could be that there's one, an hour drive from where you are, you don't have to make

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:26.260
it a big trip.

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.260
Yep, definitely.

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:33.020
And more and more, there are also some like online opportunities, right?

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:36.660
So if you really aren't close to any that are coming up soon, you can also consider

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:37.660
that route.

00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:38.660
Yeah, absolutely.

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:43.520
All right, well, I think that pretty much wraps it up.

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:46.860
Anything that we didn't cover that you think you want to throw out for people getting into

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:49.620
programming Python?

00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:54.140
So I think we did a pretty comprehensive overview, but I think the exciting thing is just if

00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:58.420
you want to learn more, there are a ton of avenues to do it and a really supportive community

00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:00.580
kind of waiting for you to help.

00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:05.220
Yeah, I think if you haven't experienced it before, I do think how supportive the community

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:08.900
is and how welcoming they are is probably going to be a surprise.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:12.020
A lot of people like you think, oh, I don't know enough, they're going to call me and

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:14.660
say, you don't know how to work on this project, get out of here.

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:21.220
Like, no, usually everyone's super excited to whatever, have you speak at their event,

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:24.260
volunteer, work on an open source project, you name it, right?

00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:25.780
That's been my experience anyway.

00:58:25.780 --> 00:58:27.580
Yeah, mine as well.

00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:28.580
Excellent.

00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:34.820
All right, well, before we get out of here, usually ask a question at the end about some

00:58:34.820 --> 00:58:38.220
PyPI project or a library that you've run across that are awesome.

00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:42.260
I mean, we can go and throw out Pydantic and Pydantic Core for everyone out there because

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:43.260
that's amazing, right?

00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:47.420
But anything else that you're like, wow, this is really awesome, people should know about?

00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:54.020
Yeah, I guess I mentioned it a little bit earlier in the podcast, but the company Astral

00:58:54.020 --> 00:59:00.220
has been working on the Ruff project, and so they originally had a linter and the code

00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:04.260
for that is written in Rust, so it's quite fast, as we discussed before.

00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:11.580
But they just came out with their Ruff format support and lots of major projects have switched

00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:12.580
over to that.

00:59:12.580 --> 00:59:15.300
So FastAPI, Pydantic, etc.

00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:21.220
And I think it's really great to see people still working super hard on high performance

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:25.980
formatting and linting tools, and it's just really quite satisfying to see things run

00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:27.860
so fast and keep things so clean.

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:31.980
So I guess give a shout out to that project, it's quite helpful.

00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:37.460
Yeah, Charlie Marsh and team over there are doing excellent work, and it's really great.

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:44.100
I think I like the way that it works, and obviously, black is kind of the de facto thing

00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:45.380
that people are choosing.

00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:49.260
So I like the ways in which it's the same as black, and I like the ways in which it's

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:50.940
different and configurable as well.

00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:52.860
So I can definitely second that one.

00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:53.860
That's a really good one.

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:58.220
Yeah, the number of configuration options that they offer are really great, and it's

00:59:58.220 --> 01:00:02.500
quite impressive that they have the 99.9% compatibility with black.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:07.180
That makes it super easy to adopt given the already existing standard.

01:00:07.180 --> 01:00:11.620
But also nice that they have really well documented differences and things like that.

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:12.620
Yeah, for sure.

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:16.940
All right, Sydney, thank you so much for being on the show.

01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:20.060
You know, I could tell that you're going to be super successful.

01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:26.140
You already are super successful, and you're months away, a good number of months, but

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:30.700
months away from graduating and really diving headfirst into this.

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.220
So you must be pretty excited.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:33.220
Yeah, congrats.

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.220
Yeah, thank you.

01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:38.860
It was so wonderful to chat with you on the podcast, and hopefully I'll see you at PyCon

01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:39.860
this next year.

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:40.860
Yeah, you as well.

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:41.860
Hope so.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:41.860
Bye.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:45.800
