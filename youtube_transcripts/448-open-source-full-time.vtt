WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040
- Hello, everyone. Charlie, Will, Eric, Sebastian, Gina, and Samuel. What a big group of people

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.000
we have here today. An awesome, awesome group. Thanks for being here, everyone.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.320
- Yeah, thanks for having us.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.720
- Yeah. It's going to be super fun to have you on the show. You know, people, I know

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.580
there's so many people out there that are dreaming of an open source project or even

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:34.280
working on open source and contributing to it, but it's something they squeeze in the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.920
last hour of their day. And at some point, all of you have made this amazing transition

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.560
to where there's enough support, there's enough interest in what you all built, that becomes

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.320
your full-time thing, right? Which is, I know for many out there, living the dream. So you

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.120
all are living the dream. Hopefully you feel that way. But it's going to be really great

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.480
to kind of just explore your projects. How do you make that transition and what you're

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:13.160
up to? So we have Samuel Colvin on from Pydantic, and he has the tightest schedule. He's squeezing

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.560
us in on a far-flung trip, work trip. So let's go to you first, Samuel. Just tell people

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.120
a bit about who you are and what your project is to get started.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.720
>> Yeah, I'm Samuel. I maintain Pydantic, which is a data validation library for Python

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.520
that uses type hints. So those weird things you've seen after the colon in Python that

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.320
mostly do nothing unless you run mypy or PyWrite, Pydantic basically enforces them. Almost exactly

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.240
a year ago, I was sort of working on Pydantic full-time by then, but really spending my

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:55.000
own money to do so. And a big American VC got in touch. And fast forward, I raised some

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.800
money and started a company, yeah, beginning of this year. I'm hired now. I have 10 people.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.360
And actually, as you mentioned, I'm in Istanbul at the moment with the whole team. It turns

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.960
out I have a team with Americans, Iranians, and Russians. Istanbul is one of the few places

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.000
that you can actually meet efficiently. So yeah, we're having a really fun week in Istanbul,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.760
mostly working together and then going out to dinner, which is where we are at the moment.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.640
I hope that's a good, quick summary.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.040
>> Yeah, absolutely. And what a cool experience that you get to hang out with all these people

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.040
talking about your project in Istanbul. I just had--

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.040
>> What did you say?

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.040
>> I was just thinking, the other thing I would add is that one of the best bits of

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.040
it has been being able to hire friends of mine from open source, people who had, I think,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.040
all but two of the people here have contributed to Finantic before we started the company,

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.040
which is how I hired the first, I think, six people, and then a few more. So one of the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.040
best bits has been hiring other people to come and work on open source with me while

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.040
still being able to pay them properly. It's been really fun.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.040
>> Yeah, awesome. I see a lot of people shaking their head out there as well. Just coincidentally,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:11.040
I recently had Sydney Rinkle on who works with you, and she's such an inspiration. That

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.040
show is not out yet, but has already been done yet through the weird time shifting of

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.040
podcasting. So it'll be out before this, but it's not out yet. So anyway, very, very cool

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:29.040
team you got there. All right, I guess we'll go around the order of the video. Brady Bunch

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.040
pictures here. So Charlie, you're up next.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:42.040
>> Yeah, sure. Hey, so I'm Charlie. I am the author of Ruff, which is a Python linter

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:49.040
code formatter and code transformation tool written in Rust. I started working on Ruff

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.040
about a year ago, like maybe like October of last year.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.040
>> Similar to Samuel, yeah.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.040
>> Yeah, and I, you know, I worked on it full time for a while, similar to Samuel, although

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.040
probably not for quite as long. I was working on it full time without any funding. And then

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:16.040
similarly, I started a company around Ruff and really around the vision of trying to

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.040
build high performance Python tools. So take some of the things that make Ruff nice to

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.040
use and popular and well-liked and try to apply those principles to other parts of the

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:35.040
Python tool chain. So, yeah, we're a team of six, and we're fully remote. So no two

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.040
of us live in the same -- I guess a couple of us live in the same country, but most of

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:51.040
us live in different countries. And we span basically U.S. central time to -- I don't

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.040
know what the -- we have one person in India and one person in Minneapolis, and that kind

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.040
of stretches like the full time zones of the team.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.040
>> That's a good stretch. That's a good stretch there. Well, absolutely congratulations on

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:12.040
Ruff. It is really, really taken off. And I know the guy right below you in the squares,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.040
Sebastian, I saw him saying nice things about it with FastAPI and so on.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.040
>> Yeah, yeah, I know. Thanks a lot. It's just funny because I think I was saying before

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.040
I started recording, I think when I came on Talk Python last time, I think that might

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.040
have been my first time ever on a podcast. And it was to talk about Ruff. And so I was

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.040
like, oh, wow, people care about what I'm doing. That's super cool. And Pydantic and

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:43.040
FastAPI were some of the earliest adopters that people had heard of. So they were like

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:48.040
very early on in the life cycle and helped a lot with, you know, getting people to see

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:54.040
Ruff and sort of care about Ruff and know that smart people are using it.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.040
>> That's awesome. Well, when you visit Talk Python or the course's website or others,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:07.040
it's all Ruff-ified. I don't know what the adjective of Ruff is, but it's been Ruff-ified.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.040
>> It's whatever you want to say.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.040
>> It's been Ruffed up and it works great. It's really amazing.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.040
>> That makes the code sound really bad.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.040
>> It's true. It's like saying it's sick. That was a sick trick they did.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.040
>> Yeah, that code is Ruff.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.040
>> Yeah, that code is Ruff, man. All right. Will, is your code Ruff? Who are you?

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.040
>> It's got some Ruff edges, certainly.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.040
>> Welcome.

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:38.040
>> Hi. I'm Will. I'm probably best known for a library called Rich. And Rich is a library

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:44.040
for writing formatted content in Terminal. You can write tables and progress bars and

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:50.040
syntax-allocated code, all sorts of things. And that became quite popular in the Python

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:57.040
world. I think there was a need for it. And two years ago, I founded Textualize, which

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:02.040
is a company which builds on Rich to produce a library called Textual, which allows you

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:10.040
to build user interfaces inside the terminal. And these are kind of like -- more like web

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.040
interfaces and less like cursors applications.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:18.040
>> Yeah, I was just thinking almost like Flexbox. You can dock stuff to the side and that's

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.040
part of the UI. But it's pretty amazing what you've built. I think it's pushed the terminal

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.040
far beyond what many people thought the terminal was going to be doing.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.040
>> It's been very cool. It's been a process of discovery. It's kind of strange. You've

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:37.040
got technology that's been around for decades. And still discovering things that it can do,

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.040
which people haven't tried before. So, yeah, it's been a lot of fun. And it's been great

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.040
to work with a small team of developers. We've got a small core here in Edinburgh, Scotland.

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:53.040
And we've got one developer in Portugal. So, yeah, it's been great. And I love the reception

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.040
and love what people are building with it.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:02.040
>> Yeah. It's -- so many people are interested in using Rich. And there's a ton of plug-ins,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:07.040
right? There's like Rich Click and there's pytest Rich and all these things. Like, well,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.040
whatever we're doing, it should also have what you've built, you know?

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:16.040
>> Yeah. Yeah. I love to see that. I love to see the ecosystem building. Our adjective

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040
is Richified.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:25.040
>> Richified. Okay. That's rich? My code is rich? Okay. Richified. Got it. I love it.

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.040
We all have adjectives that we've got to put on things.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:33.040
>> Yeah. I'm a big fan of your -- you and your team's work, by the way. I'm sure you're

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:37.040
here all the time, but you build awesome stuff. I appreciate it.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:44.040
>> Yeah. Indeed. We all are. Eric, welcome. You and I are coming in somewhat local here

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:47.040
out of Portland. Not Istanbul.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:49.040
>> I'm actually out in Bend at the moment.

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.040
>> Are you in Bend? I absolutely love Bend.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:56.040
>> Yeah. So, lots of mountains and whatnot. But, yeah. So, my background in agriculture.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.040
Folks probably know me from kind of the read the docs ecosystem. I feel like I've been

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.040
doing this for a while compared to everyone else here. The project actually started in

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:08.040
2010, which is kind of amazing. And then we actually built the -- started the company

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:13.040
around it in 2014. So, coming up next year, that'll be 10 years. And so, yeah. And we're

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.040
all bootstrapped. So, we haven't done any venture capital. It's all been kind of just

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:22.040
built up the open source and then kind of turned it into a company on top of that. We

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:26.040
kind of have a business model of doing paid for private hosting companies as well as

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.040
advertising on open source. And we spun out a kind of a separate business called

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.040
Ethical Ads that we built kind of to basically make better advertising on the

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.040
internet. Not doing any of the creepy tracking stuff.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:43.040
>> Read the docs is so critical to the open source space. Not just Python, but

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:48.040
especially Python. And then -- yeah. I mean, so, awesome work on that. And then just

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:54.040
good job on the ad stuff as well. It's -- the tendency of the whole ad space is to be

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:59.040
super creepy. And just like how much can we resell and how much can we buy to mix

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:05.040
in to create these shadow profiles. And it's not a good social trend. It's not good

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.040
for people. And it's not really necessary, right? Like, if I want to -- I've

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:13.040
sponsored ads on Read the Docs or had run ads on Read the Docs before. We had a

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:19.040
Flask course. And let's just run that ad on Flask instead of like let's see if we

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.040
can track somebody through Instagram over to Facebook.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:28.040
>> We call it newspaper advertising. And it's been really cool with the advances of

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.040
ML, the content targeting has gotten pretty good. So, it's definitely a lot easier

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:37.040
technically these days to kind of do that content matching. But yeah, I think in

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.040
terms of the kind of open source, maybe the way that I'm a little different than

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.040
other folks here is we're actually running something more akin to a service. So,

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.040
Read the Docs, all the code is open source, but a lot of the usage is open source

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.040
projects using our hosted service. We do obviously ship a lot of code. Probably our

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.040
Sphinx theme is probably the most kind of well-known actual software that people are

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:59.040
using. A little bit similar to the folks here, the kind of sidebar on the left. And

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.040
yeah, so I think that's kind of the background is, yeah, we have a little bit of

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:06.040
everything. But yeah, it's a little more akin to something like a SaaS app, I would

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:10.040
say. But the code is all open source. We do get contribution in that way as well.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.040
>> Yeah, awesome. You know, it sounds a little similar to what Textualize is

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.040
working towards as well, hosting. I mean, it's more hosting people's apps than

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.040
hosting people's apps.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.040
>> Yeah, no, I mean --

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.040
>> Not terribly different.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:24.040
>> Yeah, I mean, you know, paying for services is a classic open source

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.040
monetization strategy, right? Like you have some way to kind of build the

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.040
monetization on top.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.040
>> Yeah, it's like what you build is great, but it's kind of hard for me to run.

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:37.040
Could you just do that? Yeah, sure, we can do that. Sebastian, always good to see

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.040
you. Welcome back.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:43.040
>> Thank you very much for having me. Hello, everyone. I'm Sebastian Ramirez, or

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:50.040
Tiangolo. I created this little tool for building web APIs that is called FastAPI.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:55.040
And it has been growing quite a bit. People have liked it, fortunately. And,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.040
like, yeah, that's it. I'm probably the only one that hasn't built a company

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:08.040
here, I guess. Okay. Maybe -- okay. There are two of us. Nice. I want to hear

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:12.040
that. Okay. So this year I have been able to work full time on open source

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:17.040
because Sequoia Capital, the VC firm, started this open source fellowship. And

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:23.040
I am the first fellow, so I am kind of the test trial of the program. So I get,

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.040
you know, just to work full time on open source. And that's how I've been able

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.040
to just, yeah, release a bunch of stuff in FastAPI and the ecosystem, like the

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:35.040
other libraries. FastAPI, SQL model, and a couple of other things. But, yeah,

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:37.040
that's pretty much it.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:45.040
>> Yeah, awesome. Well, FastAPI is definitely the poster child for modern

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:51.040
Python on the web. And Samuel's work, obviously, is central to that as well,

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:57.040
right, with Pydantic being such a core element there. So very awesome.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:01.040
>> Yeah, and, like, I mean, FastAPI is built on top of, like, great open source

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.040
tools and their needs. So Pydantic does all the data validation, and on the

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:11.040
other side, Starlette does all the web parts. So, yeah, it's like -- and, like,

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:18.040
it's a very close -- how do you call it? Like, close friendship between all the

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.040
projects. Pydantic, Starlet, UbiCorn, FastAPI. Like, you know, like, we

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.040
actually know -- by this point, we actually know each other in person. Like,

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:31.040
the current maintainer of Starlette and UbiCorn works for the Pydantic company.

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.040
And he's, like, the top FastAPI expert right now. And, like, you know, like,

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:43.040
it's very nice, because it helps the dynamism of, like, the speed of building

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.040
stuff is great.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.040
>> Yeah, I imagine a lot of people don't realize the interconnections between

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.040
these different projects that are at play here. Yeah.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.040
>> Yeah, it's definitely super fun.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.040
>> Absolutely.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.040
>> And then it's worth saying we in Pydantic use FastAPI as well as

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.040
contributing to the libraries that build it. We also use FastAPI for the

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.040
services that we're building. So we're, like, consumers both directly and

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:11.040
indirectly of the things that we maintain in open source.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.040
>> Awesome.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.040
>> So, yeah, and chat quite often to Sebastian, so it's awesome.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.040
>> It's turtles all the way down, basically.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.040
>> Exactly.

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.040
>> Gina, also awesome to have you back.

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.040
>> Yeah, very happy to be back. That's really, really great to be here now, I

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:31.040
think, for the second time. So -- and the third if we call Python Bytes. So,

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:36.040
yeah, my name is Gina Häuske, and I'm probably -- yeah, I don't know if I'm

00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:40.040
that well-known throughout the Python community, but I'm quite well-known in

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:44.040
the 3D printing community for having created OctoPrint, which is the snappy

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.040
web interface for your 3D printer, and the server part of that is all written

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:54.040
in Python. And I started a project back in 2012 when I got my first 3D printer

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:59.040
as a regular pet project on the side after hours, vacation, blah, blah, blah.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:05.040
In 2014, I got hired by a 3D printing company to work on it full-time, and in

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.040
2016, that company ran out of money, and I suddenly found myself with a full

00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:15.040
fledged, full-grown open source project and no funding whatsoever. So I tried

00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:19.040
this whole crowdfunding stuff with Patreon, and that is pretty much how I've

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:25.040
been working ever since. So I'm self-employed under German law. I'm a

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:32.040
freelancer, and yeah, all my income comes from people who just sent me money

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.040
for working on OctoPrint.

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.040
>> Did you say since 2016?

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.040
>> Since 2016, yeah.

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.040
>> Wow, okay, cool.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.040
>> So full-time since 2014, and self-employed and crowdfunded since 2016.

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:48.040
So it's been a while.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:53.040
>> That's awesome. I also went full-time on all my stuff here in 2016, although

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.040
it's basically not open source. It talks a whole lot about open source stuff.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.040
>> Totally.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.040
>> Awesome. It's been a while. Congratulations.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.040
>> Thank you. I'm still surprised it works, to be honest. I'm waiting every

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.040
day that it stops working, and yeah, actually, this year, it came a bit close,

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.040
and then I put out a blog post basically along the lines of, you know, the

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.040
income is going this, but the usage numbers are going that, so something is

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:20.040
amiss here, and we need to talk. And then the community rallied, and stuff

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:23.040
fixed itself again, so that's pretty amazing.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.040
>> That's really awesome. Congratulations. It's easy for people to just go, oh,

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:31.040
it's free, and there's some people supporting it, and just kind of assume that

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.040
things are taken care of.

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.040
>> Yeah.

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:39.040
>> Yeah. Really good. Really good. Yeah, you have a ton of supporters on

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.040
GitHub sponsors as well, right?

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:46.040
>> Yeah. Actually, I've diversified over the years, and in the beginning, it was

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.040
just Patreon and PayPal, and then I started adding new payment platforms and

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.040
options, because people prefer to be able to use the stuff that they know, and

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.040
some people don't like Patreon, some people don't like and don't know GitHub

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:02.040
sponsors and stuff, and so you just give them the options to choose whatever they

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.040
feel comfortable with, and this increases the likelihood that they actually will

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.040
go through with throwing something in your head, so to speak.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.040
>> Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.040
>> At least that's my feeling. I don't know.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.040
>> I think that GitHub sponsors has been really positive for open source.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.040
>> Absolutely.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:20.040
>> I think it's made it pretty easy to just check a box. They already have your

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:23.040
credit card, potentially, and you just want to give a little support instead of,

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:28.040
you know, one-time PayPal donation here that you forget about after once and all

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.040
that.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.040
>> Yeah.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:36.040
>> Yeah. Before we move on here, there's a funny comment, nice comment out.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:41.040
Kanishka says, "This group, look at all of you. You guys are the Avengers of

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:45.040
Python open source," right, which is kind of like the superheroes. I love it.

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:51.040
It's somewhat actually true, it seems. Okay. So the next thing I want to ask is a

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:57.040
little bit of an origin story. Just, you know, what projects did you try and that

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.040
didn't really get traction, and then, you know, how do you think that your project

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:04.040
got traction here? And I know, Samuel, you might vanish any minute, so you're

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.040
next. You're up first on this one.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:10.040
>> That's a really interesting. I've built a number of things in open source. I

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:15.040
started something last week. Open source on Friday, but has gotten more stars over

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:21.040
the last three days or, I guess, week now. The first project I started, ARQ, has

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:26.040
over, I think, coming up on six years. So I mean, that's front end, and front end

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:33.040
gets a lot more traction than, like, queuing in RPC does. But, yeah, I don't know

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.040
how, like, obviously there were some things I played with back then that never

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:40.040
took off, but, yeah, it was this, like, I think I was in the right time, right

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.040
place with PyPens. They'd obviously been around in Python for a long time, but back

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:48.040
in 2017 when I started in PyLantic, their usage was growing really fast, and I think

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.040
there were lots of people like me who found it kind of frustrating that they were

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.040
there and didn't do anything. So, yeah, I think being in the right time, right place

00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:00.040
was super valuable for me. And obviously, like, great projects like FastAPI,

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.040
adopting PyLantic, it made a big difference, but I don't know. What's weird, if

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.040
you look at the download chart, it's like, it was this inflection point at the

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:12.040
beginning of 2021, so then we had, like, 5 million downloads a month, and since

00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:18.040
then it's been kind of almost exactly linear growth to now 125 million downloads

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.040
a month. So something weird happened in 2021, long after the project was started,

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:26.040
I don't know. But, yeah, I think it was right place, right time, and, yeah, and

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:29.040
thus frustration was the starting point. On that note, I'm going to have to rush

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.040
guys a bit. It was great to see everyone, and I'm sure I'll meet you all at a

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.040
conference soon. Bye-bye.

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:35.040
- Yeah, thanks for dropping in.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:36.040
- Good to see you.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.040
- Bye-bye.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:43.040
- All right. Charlie, keep going around the circle here.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:50.040
- Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, you know, it's interesting because I, like, this

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:59.040
is, Ruff is really my first time being a maintainer and, like, publishing open,

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.040
like, I've been a consumer of open source, right, for my whole career, but I was

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:07.040
never really, I guess, like, a creator or a publisher or a maintainer of open

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:15.040
source. And it's, you know, around the time that I started working on Ruff, I was

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:19.040
working on, like, a couple different projects, and they all, I was kind of

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.040
trying to figure out what I wanted to do next. I'd left my job recently, and RUF

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.040
was kind of motivated by a lot of the experiences I had at my job where I was,

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:29.040
like, maintaining a large Python code base.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.040
- Did you leave your job with the intent of going to work on Ruff, or were you just

00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:35.040
like, I'm going to leave, and then I'm going to figure something out?

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:44.040
- It's funny. I left my job with the intent of starting a company, but I did not

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.040
think it would be Ruff, and Ruff was, like, this distracting side project that I was

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.040
working on while I was, like, I was working with a friend, and we were, like,

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:56.040
trying to figure out, like, the Venn diagram of interests, of, like, what are we

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:00.040
willing to work on full-time together, what makes sense given, like, our interests,

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.040
and then in all my free time, I was, like, I just want to work on developer tools,

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:11.040
and, like, I worked on, I built Ruff, or I started building Ruff. I worked on, like,

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:14.040
yeah, I worked on a lot of different, not a lot, but, like, I was working on a

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:18.040
couple different projects. I did, like, a sort of CI/CD thing where you, like,

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:24.040
write Docker files and, like, CI files in TypeScript, and they, like, trans-file

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:30.040
down, and I was, like, I think that has a lot of cool ideas. I worked on, like,

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:36.040
it was pretty early in a lot of the LLM stuff. I worked on, like, a code-based

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.040
wide refactoring tool where you, like, give it examples of, like, before and

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.040
after, and then it tries to find examples. It was, like, a co-pilot for your entire

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:46.040
code base. It didn't work that well, like, at scale, but it was, like, a cool idea.

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.040
So I was, like, working on the stuff that was all open source.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.040
- Maybe it could have been a timing thing. Like, maybe today that would be all the...

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.040
- Yeah, I mean, it's also, like, you know, it's also an effort thing, I guess.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.040
Like, I put a lot more into Ruff, and it was interesting because I kept viewing

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:06.040
RUF as, like, you know, it was probably open source at that point, but I don't

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.040
think I had, like, launched it. And I kept viewing it as, like, like I said,

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.040
like a little bit of a distraction, and my friend was, like, you know, I think

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.040
you should really, like, push to, like, release this because, like, if you think

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.040
it's, like, interesting, then, like, other people will probably think it's

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.040
interesting. And he was the person that really, like, motivated me to actually,

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:33.040
like, see it through to doing the release. And then I did the release, and, like, a

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.040
lot of people were actually interested in it, so that kind of gave me, like, the

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.040
energy to, like, really start working on it full-time and just kind of see where it

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.040
went. And it was really, like, projects like Pydantic and, like, Sebastian started,

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:50.040
like, commenting on issues and stuff, and I was, like, wow, like, real serious

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:55.040
projects are looking at this, like, crazy tool. And let me just see. I'm just going

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.040
to do whatever it takes to make it, like, a feasible choice for them and just

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:02.040
started, like, you know, cranking through, like, all the issues and all the things

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:07.040
that we were missing. So it escalated pretty quickly, I think.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.040
- Yeah. Did it surprise you?

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:18.040
- Oh, yes. Yes. Absolutely. I mean, like, well, I was convinced that, like, I was

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:23.040
convinced that I had faced, like, this problem around tooling as, like, our

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.040
codebase got large in my last company and that there was an opportunity to, like,

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.040
build, like, better, more performant tooling. I wasn't sure how much -- I

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.040
genuinely wasn't sure, like, how widely that message would resonate with people.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:41.040
And so, I don't know. It's, like, a little bit of luck, right? Like, sometimes you

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:45.040
work on great projects and then, like, they go nowhere and, like, just no one

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.040
happens to see it. And then sometimes you work on a good thing and, like, it does

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:51.040
go somewhere. And so there are certain things that are within your control,

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.040
certain things that aren't. I feel like we did -- I did a good job of, like,

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.040
communicating the project and, like, why it was interesting and why it was

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.040
exciting. But I also feel like I got a little bit lucky that it just, like,

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.040
gravitated towards the right people and got attention in the right ways.

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:09.040
- Sure. Also, maybe that Black had existed, which is a little ironic because

00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.040
Black kind of solves a real similar problem. But, like, people were, okay, we

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.040
embrace the idea of the thing that Rough does really well. You know, you're

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.040
convinced them to use Rough in that sense.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:22.040
- Yeah. I mean, we have a little bit -- I mean, it gets back to this. Like, we

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:28.040
have a little bit of, like, a second-mover advantage, right? Where, like,

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:32.040
there's a lot of existing tools that people use already and, like, a lot of

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:36.040
those practices, like, the idea of using a format or the idea of running code

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:40.040
mods, like, the idea of using a linter and, like, the knowledge of, like, what

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:46.040
kinds of rules are valuable and, like, what kinds of analysis we can do. Like,

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:50.040
all that stuff existed. And that was part of the story, really, was I was, like,

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.040
these tools are great and I get a lot of value out of them, but I want them to be,

00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.040
like, easier and faster. And so, yeah, there's definitely a strong timing thing.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.040
I think, like, I think Rust, too, this is maybe, like, a little bit more

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:08.040
specific to what we're doing, but, like, you know, I think, like, the

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:13.040
intersection between Python and Rust has gotten -- or the -- I guess the

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.040
interoperability between them and sort of the ecosystem around it has just grown a

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.040
lot. I mean, still, I would say, like, pretty early, but it's, like, matured and

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:25.040
grown a lot over the past few years. And so, even just the fact that, like, at my

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:29.040
last company, we started to introduce Rust and we started to, like, move some of our

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:34.040
core systems into Rust and expose them over Py03. Like, the fact that that existed

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.040
and the fact that I was, like, exposed to that, like, that's all just, like, pure

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.040
chance. Otherwise, I never would have thought to do this.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:45.040
>> Yeah. Very cool. Well, congrats. Well-deserved.

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.040
>> Thanks.

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:54.040
>> All using Ruff, as we said. It was excellent. Will, Rich is awesome. Why do

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:58.040
you think it took off? Did you try stuff before?

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:05.040
>> Yeah. I tried a lot of stuff before. Before GitHub, you know, coding has always

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:10.040
been my hobby. You know, I do it for work. I come home and work on a hobby project.

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.040
And it just seemed natural to want to share it. Pre-GitHub, I would just put stuff

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:20.040
on my blog and get some feedback from it there. I quite enjoyed that. And, yeah, I

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:28.040
did a number of open source projects pre-Rich. I had a BB code parsing library. I

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:36.040
had a chess library. I had a web toolkit. So, yeah, when Rich came along, it was

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.040
another hobby project. Something to keep me entertained.

00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.040
>> Why is this terminal so boring? Come on. See what we can do.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.040
>> Yeah. I'd always used the terminal. And I always struggled when you've got a

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:52.040
bunch of white text on black background and you're trying to pick out an IP

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:56.040
address from somewhere. And, you know, I'd always wished, oh, I wish it would just

00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:00.040
format it and colorize it for me. I know this is possible, but it doesn't happen.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:06.040
So, then, yeah, I just started it. And it came together quite well. When I released

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:11.040
it, it was like, boom. The stars just started accumulating. I got lots of

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:18.040
feedback. It was very exciting. And I kept building on it. It was kind of like

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:22.040
issue driven development. So, people would just ask for something. Oh, that's a good

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:28.040
idea. And go ahead and add that and implement it. And it grew from there. And it

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:34.040
became really large. I did actually prior to Rich, I had a library called Py File

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:39.040
System. And this is kind of like a wrapper to file systems. So, you can have the

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:45.040
same interface for your FTP server as a hard drive or a zip file, S3 bucket. And

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:51.040
that got some use in the community. It wasn't enormous. But that taught me a lot

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:58.040
about building open source. You know, managing feedback and issues, et cetera.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:04.040
So, that was a great experience when I started working on Rich. And I was very

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:09.040
surprised actually how successful it became. The first time I realized that this

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:14.040
was bigger than just a hobby project is when someone told me off for violating

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:20.040
SemVer, I released a clear breaking change because I thought, nobody's using that

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:28.040
yet. So, the next day I got told off quite appropriately. And then I thought, okay,

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:33.040
I'll have to take this more seriously. If people are using this in their day job,

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.040
they can't just have someone who's just like throwing new bits of code and

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:44.040
changing functionality. They had to treat it like it was an actual my day job.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:48.040
>> Yeah. Well, everyone on the call here probably has a little bit of nervousness

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:53.040
about like, if I break this, there are a lot of people that depend on this thing.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.040
>> Yeah. And it's so different. Like, it just changes so much. Like, when you

00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:01.040
were talking about the issue driven development thing, too, I was like, I just

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:05.040
remember that phase of like, rough, where it was like, anyone who cared at all

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:10.040
about the project, all I wanted to do was make them happy. Oh, wow, that seems

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:15.040
like a cool idea. Let's definitely do it. It was the point in time where I could

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:19.040
fix the bug, cut a release the same day, and then their thing is fixed. And then

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.040
it's like, okay, great, now we have a relationship. Thanks for using my thing,

00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:27.040
blah, blah, blah. But that's changed so much. Because then I went through the

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:31.040
same experiences of like, I ship a release with a break and change that I didn't

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.040
really document, a lot of people get upset, and then you realize, okay, I actually

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.040
have some more responsibility now.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:42.040
>> Yeah, these days, it's more like trying to find the balance between saying no to

00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.040
stuff that you then have to end up maintaining and not like, disappointing

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:52.040
people too much because you say no or things like that. And then trying to keep

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:58.040
this whole interaction with people nice, even though you don't want to do stuff

00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.040
they want you to do.

00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.040
>> Yeah, I have this analogy.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.040
>> Because you know it's better for the project.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:10.040
>> Yeah, PRs are like cake or puppies. If it's a simple bug fix, that's like cake.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:15.040
You're like, thank you, I enjoyed that cake, then move on. But some PRs are like

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:21.040
a puppy. It's like, perfect, you like puppies, but you've got to feed them and

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.040
clean up after them.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.040
>> Why am I staying in the rain with this puppy on a Friday night? How do I get

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.040
here?

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.040
>> Yeah, so sometimes you have to say --

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.040
>> Collecting the puppy's poop.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.040
>> Yeah, exactly.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.040
>> Sometimes you say, thank you, but I just can't look after another puppy right

00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:41.040
now. And that's a difficult thing to come to terms with when the project gets a

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:46.040
bit more mature. Because previously you're accepting all the puppies, but then you

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:51.040
have to start saying no to puppies. And Rich definitely got there.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.040
>> Will, do you hate puppies? Come on, that's a pretty hard stance.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:59.040
>> I'm kind of a cat person, to be honest with you. But yeah, I mean, you have to

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:01.040
say no eventually.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:06.040
>> I think this is where plug-ins always kind of like take the center stage, right?

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.040
You're like, oh, that sounds like a great idea for you to maintain external to my

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:11.040
library.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:16.040
>> That was exactly my approach to the whole situation, yeah.

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.040
>> Yeah, sounds like it.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.040
>> Have fun.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:25.040
>> But also the probability of some little change breaking someone's code and being

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:32.040
considered a breaking change grows as the project grows in usage. And at some point

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:37.040
it's like almost any change will end up breaking someone in very unexpected ways.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:41.040
Because they are doing something really, really weird, but you know, like someone

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:46.040
is doing it. So it becomes more and more difficult to know, like, is this a breaking

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:52.040
change or not? Like, no, I should be using this variable here or this parameter, but

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:56.040
like, you know, there's someone out there doing that. So I don't know. I feel

00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:04.040
defining what is actually a breaking change and what is a strict semver gets more

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:08.040
difficult as things grow. Yeah, I don't know.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:12.040
>> One of the things I like that the Django project did was basically only things

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.040
that are documented are supported, basically. That was kind of the line they drew, and

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.040
I thought that was a pretty good way to draw it. But yeah, you're always -- that

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:23.040
never actually works. That doesn't make people happy. It just gives you plausible

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.040
deniability.

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:27.040
>> Don't yell at me. It's not my fault.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:32.040
>> Yeah, I think adding a formal versioning policy is one of the best things that we

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:38.040
did. Because for a long time, Ruff was just -- we only used patch releases. So we

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:45.040
got to like 0.0, like 285 or something. And we had basically no guarantees about

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:50.040
what would or wouldn't change, like, across releases. And as the project got more

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:54.040
and more popular, like, that started to cause more and more problems. And so Zaney,

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.040
someone on our team, when they joined, one of the first few things they did was

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.040
add a formal versioning policy, and we added preview behavior. So you can opt --

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:08.040
similar to what Block has, you can opt in to breaking or more experimental changes.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.040
And so now we have clear expectations around what it means to bump a minor release,

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:16.040
et cetera, et cetera. And that has made our lives a lot easier, actually having

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:20.040
clear expectations around that that are communicated and respected. It's the kind

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:25.040
of thing that you just don't think about at all, at least I didn't, until Ratchet

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.040
got bigger.

00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:33.040
>> Yeah. Some people's code runs things like FastAPI or Octoprint or whatever.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:37.040
Your stuff rewrites people's code.

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:43.040
>> Yeah. But it's run at run time. I don't know. I actually think it's easier.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.040
>> Yeah.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:51.040
>> I do say -- I mean, it's like -- it's funny you talk about the plugins thing,

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:55.040
because, like, I've actually very intentionally taken the opposite approach,

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.040
which is we have, like, almost no public API. Because, like, the only public API

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:05.040
is the CLI. And, like, we don't expose our API in any other way. And that's

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.040
because, like, we know we're going to change, like, everything internally, like,

00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:12.040
pretty dramatically. And so we wanted to have, like, full control over that

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.040
without having to worry about breaking people's stuff yet. But it's, like -- it's

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:19.040
starting to become more of a problem, because more and more people want to use

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.040
it as a library in, like, different ways. But it's -- I don't know. It's, like --

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.040
it's sort of a counterintuitive way to, like, make our lives easier as

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:30.040
maintainers, was, like, not expose any public API, apart from the CLI.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.040
>> Yeah. Yeah. Very interesting.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:37.040
>> There's a funny sort of anecdote. I'm rewriting a lot of the documentation

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:42.040
for SQL model, because I want to have examples -- right now I have examples

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:47.040
that are compatible with Python 3.7 and above. But I want to have also the

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:52.040
syntax for 3.9 and 3.10. In 3.10, you can have, like, the unions using the

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.040
vertical bar and these things. And I want to have examples for each one of

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.040
those. So the approach I did was to write a script that will automatically

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:04.040
update each one of the files by calling rough as a soup process. So that's the

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.040
API. And then, like, you know, like --

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.040
>> Yeah.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.040
>> Like, doing all that stuff. But, like, yeah. Like, another -- another

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.040
example.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.040
>> Yeah. Great.

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.040
>> That's great.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:18.040
>> Using as an API before it's --

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.040
>> I've heard this before as --

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.040
>> API, right.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.040
>> Yeah.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.040
>> It would be created.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.040
>> Exactly. I've heard this before as, like, Hiram's law, which is, like,

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:30.040
with a sufficiently large number of users, like, any implementation detail

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:34.040
becomes -- someone will eventually rely on an implementation detail. Like,

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.040
any arbitrary implementation, someone is probably relying on that behavior,

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.040
which is basically the behavior of the program is the API in the end.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.040
>> Unfortunately.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:46.040
>> Yeah. They'll find the underscore functions. You've tried to dissuade them

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:52.040
from using it and all the things. Yeah. Eric, what's the origin story for

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:55.040
Read the Docs, and what did you try, and how do you think it caught on?

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.040
>> Yeah. So, I mean, this was kind of way back in the day. But, yeah, I kind

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:03.040
of got started writing Django plugins, you know, apropos to the conversation.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.040
You know, I was working at the Lawrence Journal World, where Django came

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.040
from, and it was kind of early in my career, and I was just kind of getting

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:13.040
excited about open source and blogging, and just basically built a few of

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:17.040
these kind of testing-related open source projects. And then that was kind

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.040
of where I got started with open source. And then basically it was the

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.040
classic scratch-o-niche thing, right? Like, it's like, I have a bunch of

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:27.040
open source projects I want to write documentation. How do I solve that

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:31.040
problem? And back in the day, that was a much harder problem to solve,

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:35.040
right? It was basically just, like, build a zip file and upload it to

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:40.040
packages.python.org, if folks remember that one. Or was it packages or

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:44.040
whatever the docs -- there was a docs hosting on PyPI, basically. And,

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.040
yeah, basically just wanted to kind of build a better version of that

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:50.040
that integrated with GitHub. I feel like webhooks were, like, the cool new

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:55.040
thing back in 2010, you know? And so that was really kind of the insight,

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:58.040
right? It's like, let's build this kind of, like, CI/CD workflow on top of

00:36:58.040 --> 00:37:02.040
webhooks. And I actually did build kind of a version of that the previous

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:06.040
year around kind of, like, code quality stuff. So it actually ran kind of

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.040
like a linter and built a website on commit and had a similar kind of

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.040
workflow, right? Where it gave you a grade and did all this kind of stuff,

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:18.040
which is, like, 2009. And, yeah, that didn't really catch on at all. But

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.040
then I think read the docs, just rebuilt it. And then I was using it for my

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.040
own projects. And I actually had the need to kind of maintain it and keep

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.040
it updated. And then I think people just kind of grew naturally. You know,

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:31.040
gave some conference talks, that kind of stuff. But I think it just solved

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:35.040
a problem that people had. And that's always going to be the best way to

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.040
grow a thing. So.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:41.040
- Yeah, absolutely. Awesome. What's read the docs written in? Is it Django?

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:44.040
- Yep. Yeah, it's all Django and Python.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:50.040
- Right on. Funny coincidence. I went to college in Lawrence at the

00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.040
University of Kansas.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.040
- Oh, nice.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.040
- I was right there, right at the heart of Django. But I moved off to grad

00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:00.040
school, like, a couple years before all that happened. So I missed the

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:01.040
excitement.

00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.040
- It's funny, everybody, I grew up in Virginia, and everyone was like,

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.040
"You're going to Kansas? You graduated school? How are you going there?

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:09.040
Like, what?" Everybody thought it was the weirdest decision. But yeah,

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:13.040
I really do think, you know, ending up in that Python and Django ecosystem

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.040
has been pretty transformative to my life.

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.040
- Yeah.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.040
- So, you know, worked out.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.040
- Lawrence is a pretty cool little town, actually. Of all the places.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.040
- Yeah.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:26.040
- Sebastian, how'd you come about this crazy idea to put types into our

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.040
web apps? You know Python, that's dynamic. It doesn't have types. What

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.040
are you doing?

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:35.040
- Yeah. I don't know. It's so crazy. It's so fun to see. It said Michael

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:40.040
Larson in the chat, like, "They maintain our URL need three, and the Python

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:44.040
security developer in Resilience," just like, chatting along with us. Like,

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:48.040
he probably has had to use so much stuff as us.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.040
- Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:55.040
- So, like, some of the first things that I did in open source were actually

00:38:55.040 --> 00:39:00.040
Docker images for deploying Flask, because I was working with Flask. And

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:06.040
deploying Flask was difficult, and I needed to be able to combine Nginx with

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:10.040
UWSGI and, like, a bunch of things. And, like, they all had their own custom

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:14.040
configuration files, and it was, you know, like, so difficult. I didn't like

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:18.040
doing that, and then I just had to study how to do that stuff. And then after

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:22.040
going through all that, I wanted to save everyone else's time doing that.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:23.040
- Yeah.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:27.040
- So, I was like, "Let's just put a Docker image with this, and a lot of

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.040
documentation of how this Docker image works, and how you can use it with some

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:35.040
sensible defaults." So, you know, it was just like a weird contraption. That was

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:39.040
it. But it actually grew, and, like, got, like, a few stars, like, a bunch of

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:43.040
stars. For me, it was a lot, like, you know, like, a hundred stars. Oh, my gosh,

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:47.040
I'm an open source developer. And then, like, at some point, it had, like, a

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.040
thousand stars or something like that. I was so happy about that. And at some

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:56.040
point, it was kind of the de facto standard for doing Flask in Docker. That was

00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:02.040
then the first thing that I did. I ended up with FastAPI. I was avoiding building

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.040
FastAPI for a long while, and I was trying all the other frameworks and all the

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:10.040
other tools. I was convinced that there was something that would do the things

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:15.040
that I wanted. I just had to find it. And as I was trying different frameworks,

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.040
also in different languages, I was extending the list of things that I wanted

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:23.040
to have, and also a list of things that I wanted not to have. For example, I

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.040
didn't want --

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.040
>> That takes you farther and farther away from any frameworks.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:32.040
>> Exactly. Having one that would tick all the boxes. So it was like, ah. But

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:36.040
then I realized, like, I really like this thing of having types, as in TypeScript,

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:39.040
because you get out the completion and inline errors. And this is so cool. It's

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:43.040
so cool to be able to have this. I want to have this in Python. And in Python,

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:47.040
other type annotations. And it's like, this is great. How do I use them? There's

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:51.040
no way to use them with the current frameworks. So at some point I actually

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:56.040
found the right framework. It was called API star, by the same author of Django

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.040
Rust framework. And it was just missing some authentication stuff. I said,

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:04.040
okay, I'm going to contribute to the stuff. When I was about to jump into the

00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:09.040
code, he said, I have to deprecate this. I will go focus full on Starlet. And

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.040
then he went to build Starlet. This is Tom Christie, which is super prolific

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:18.040
and an amazing open source person in general. And then at that point is when I

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:24.040
said, like, ah, I just have to try it. Let's just do it. So I'm just going to

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:29.040
try to build something that will be kind of a spiritual successor to API star,

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:33.040
built on top of Starlet. So I was, you know, like, I was actually inheriting

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:38.040
all the learnings from Flask, Django, Django Rust framework, and all the

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:42.040
ecosystem, and just, like, bringing all those ideas together. At least that was

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:47.040
my intention. And then I wanted to have a bit of better type annotations. So I

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:50.040
saw that Pydantic was using standard type annotations. So people wouldn't have to

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:54.040
learn this, like, you know, from FastAPI import special string or something like

00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:58.040
that. Just instead of that, just pure string. So I wanted to have something

00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:03.040
based on standards, like open API, JSON schema, and all the stuff. And based on

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:07.040
standard Python and to have, like, the simplest syntax possible and to, you

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:11.040
know, like, give the best developer experience possible, while, you know,

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:17.040
like, not adding, like, any additional steps for developers to build something

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:21.040
that by default will have all the best practices built in. That was the

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:25.040
intention. And I was just, like, trying to solve it for the things that I was

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:29.040
working on. I was supposed to be doing AI and machine learning and stuff, but,

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:34.040
like, I had to stop for a bit to solve APIs, and I got stuck in APIs. And that's

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:38.040
how I ended up with FastAPI. >> I think you made a pretty decent choice. It

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:43.040
seems like FastAPI is doing all right. >> Yeah. >> I just saw you -- >> Much

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:47.040
better than what I ever had expected. >> Yeah, I know. Congratulations. Well,

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:54.040
it's also deserved. But I also just saw an X, I don't know, a post on X Twitter,

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:58.040
whatever you -- however you address these things, where you said -- you showed a

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:04.040
graph where the number of GitHub stars for FastAPI just passed Flask. And, you

00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:09.040
know, I have a lot of respect for Flask and the Paladins team and David Lord and

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.040
all those folks. But, you know, awesome. Awesome that your stuff has taken off so

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.040
much. That's really cool. >> Yeah, it's super cool. It's amazing. And, you

00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:20.040
know, like, Flask was one of the big inspirations for FastAPI, and I've been

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:28.040
able to be at this point. It's crazy. Like, yeah. I still can't, you know, get

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:32.040
over it. Yeah, super cool. Super cool to be able to build all this and to keep

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:37.040
building more stuff. So, yeah, super nice. >> Yeah. One final comment before we

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:43.040
move on to OctoPrint. But one of the things I kind of see you doing in the world

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:46.040
is you're like the combiner. You're like, oh, we've got this cool stuff with

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:52.040
Pydantic and Starlet. Now, can we combine it in this way to make this, you know,

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:56.040
and Swagger? And similarly with SQL model, you're like, well, Pydantic is

00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:00.040
cool, but SQLAlchemy is kind of cool, but it could be more better. It could be

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:04.040
better, right? So, anyway, good job. >> Yeah, and also like Typer. That is the

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:08.040
way for building command line applications. You just click with the type

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:12.040
annotations, the same ideas from Pydantic, and now with integrated building

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:18.040
support for Reach. So, like also picking Will's work, trying just to put a bunch

00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:21.040
of things together. I'm just, you know, like I'm just making cocktails

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:25.040
everywhere. >> Yes, exactly. >> It's more than that, but there is a lot of

00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:30.040
value in combining things in a smart way, an accessible way. >> Yeah. Yeah,

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.040
awesome. All right. Gina, you told us a little bit about the origin story, but

00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:37.040
like what did you try before? And then I have a follow-up question I think is

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.040
unique to your project. >> I wouldn't necessarily say that I tried anything

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.040
before because the whole thing was completely unintentional. I mean, I

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:50.040
basically bought myself a 3D printer in late 2012. I wanted to be able to put it

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:55.040
in my spare bathroom and monitor it from afar because back then this thing was

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:59.040
tying up my PC. You had to constantly keep it connected so it could operate and

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:03.040
that for hours and hours, and it made noises and it produced fumes, and I just

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:08.040
wanted it out of my office. And to be able to play games on my PC again instead

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:14.040
of having it, yeah, basically communicate constantly with a 3D printer. And so I

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:18.040
bought myself a Raspberry Pi and I was looking online for something to be able

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:22.040
to just put on this Pi and attach to the printer and throw a Wi-Fi dongle in

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:25.040
because back then the Pi didn't have Wi-Fi built in, and throw that in the

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:29.040
spare bathroom, but there wasn't anything. So over the course of my Christmas

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:34.040
break in 2012, I sat down and changed that. And this is basically the origin

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:38.040
story of Octoprint. I just wanted to scratch my own itch. I wanted to put my

00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:42.040
printer in my spare bathroom. This is all. And apparently a lot of people had the

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:47.040
same problem because I just, you know, like how we like to do these things. We

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.040
build something that we think might be interesting. We throw it up on GitHub and

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:55.040
go just like here, go nuts, enjoy, have fun with that. And I suddenly started

00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.040
getting emails from all around the world like, "Hey, I have this and this

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:03.040
printer. Can you also make it work with that?" And so this escalated and I went

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:07.040
like, "Oh, someone is using it. Of course I'm going to add this support. And of

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:11.040
course I'm going to add this feature." And it just grew and grew and grew and

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:15.040
grew. And apparently I just hit a nerve. So this was utterly unplanned. This was

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:22.040
never my intention at all. And I just wanted to solve my own problem and have

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:27.040
continued to solve my own problems and the problems of other people ever since.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.040
Before Octoprint, I actually was also quite active in a little project called

00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:37.040
DokuWiki where I was developing some plugins for that. And I even did open

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:42.040
source before I knew what open source was with some PHP scripts when I was 18 or

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:48.040
so that I threw up on my website. But yeah, Octoprint was like, it took over my

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:54.040
life. It just was an accident, a happy little accident maybe.

00:46:54.040 --> 00:47:00.040
How did you decide, "Okay, this is a job for me rather than just a thing you

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.040
worked on?"

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:09.040
Yeah, so the thing is, by mid-2013, I went to 80% on my regular day job. I used

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:14.040
to be a software architect/consultant with big corporation, Java World, all that

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:20.040
enterprise stuff. And to be able to dedicate one day per week fully to

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:24.040
Octoprint, plus of course the weekends and the after hours and the vacations and

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:30.040
all of that. And that still didn't suffice anymore by 2014. And I noticed that it

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:35.040
was impacting my health, it was impacting my relationships. And that was actually

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:39.040
quite perfect timing really when this company that hired me initially approached

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:43.040
me and said, "Hey, do you want to maybe fly out to us and we'll chat? And if you

00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:48.040
like all of that, what we have to propose, then we can just do that." And this is

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:55.040
how it then continued to go from 2014 until 2016. And yeah, it was never my

00:47:55.040 --> 00:48:00.040
intention to become self-employed. I'm a quite risk-averse person actually. So

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:06.040
when this point came where I was like, "Okay, either I find a way to keep funding

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:11.040
this or I have to really drop it," because it was way too big by then to be kept as

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:17.040
a pet project without being utterly, utterly unhealthy. Yeah, I decided to jump

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:22.040
into the cold water and have been trying to keep up at the surface ever since

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:26.040
basically. So yeah, all of that really completely unplanned.

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.040
- Yeah, cool. What an adventure, huh?

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:33.040
- Indeed, yeah. And the good thing is even if people don't understand what open

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:37.040
sources or what code is, I always have quite a topic at parties. So that is fun

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:42.040
because, yeah, people give you money for something they can get for free? What?

00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:48.040
- Exactly. Yeah, if you're not familiar with open source, then it definitely is a

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.040
weird thing to say.

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.040
- Absolutely. It was tricky to find a text consultant who understands the concept.

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.040
- Yeah, I can imagine.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.040
- Yeah, that's interesting.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:03.040
- I'm sure. All right.

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:07.040
- I was reading recently, I was like, "What do you do? What is your day job?"

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.040
And they're like, "Oh, I'm a software developer." So you work for a company.

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:13.040
- I mean, you're free.

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:18.040
- I build software that is free for others to use. And who's paying you? A company

00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:23.040
that pays money to companies to build companies. So you're building a company.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:29.040
No, it's like, you know, like it was a long conversation. They got bored and left.

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:32.040
That was it.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.040
- This doesn't make any sense, yeah.

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:37.040
- I've just taken to say I'm a software developer and I work with 3D printers.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:40.040
And then people usually stop asking questions because 3D printers are this

00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:45.040
mysterious thing that no one understands. Anyhow, usually at least. And then, yeah.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:49.040
Unless they say, "Oh, 3D printers." And then I say, "Yeah, do you know 3D printers?"

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:52.040
And they go, "Yeah, yeah, I have one." And then I can say, "Oh, do you know OctoPrint?"

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.040
"Yes." "Oh, yeah, I made that." And then, "Oh."

00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.040
- Yeah.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:00.040
- Yeah, it's tricky to explain to people. I'm sometimes not even sure my parents

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.040
understand what I do.

00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:10.040
- I'm sure that my parents don't understand what I do. But that's okay. I'm sure they're

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.040
still proud of you anyway. It's fine.

00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.040
- Yeah, my parents are probably proud of me.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:18.040
- I would like to just maybe…we're getting a little short on time here.

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:25.040
Coming up to the end of our Avengers meeting. Let's close it out with this.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:28.040
Go around one more time. Let you all, or maybe just as a group, kind of chime in

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:34.040
on this. Speaking to the people out there listening who want to start an open source

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:37.040
project or want to contribute to open source or somehow kind of get involved in

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:45.040
similar ways, what would you do different if you started now? Many of you have been

00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:49.040
working on this for a long time. You've had a lot of experience. If somebody said,

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:56.040
"Well, the world is…somehow the memory has been erased from the fact that Ruff or

00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:02.040
Rich or OctoPrint or whatever existed to start over," what would you do different or

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.040
the same?

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:06.040
- I would use FastAPI.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:10.040
- Yay!

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:14.040
- Yeah, good use of a time machine there. I've had multiple conversations over the

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:17.040
years where people are like, "Why don't you use this library?" And I'm like, "Oh, it

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:18.040
didn't exist."

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.040
- Exactly. Yeah, that's the problem.

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:22.040
- Exactly.

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:26.040
- Yeah, and when you actually have a plug-in system, then swapping out stuff like

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.040
that can become very tricky.

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:36.040
- Absolutely.

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:41.040
- I don't know. When I get asked how to, what to work on, what to study, what to

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:47.040
focus, how to get into open source or like almost any of those questions, I always say

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:54.040
that the main advice I give is just to focus on a problem that is important to you more

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:59.040
than, you know, like innovation, market disruption or whatever. Just like focus on a

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:03.040
problem that is actually important to you, hopefully that is important to others as

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:06.040
well. And if it's not a problem that affects you directly, hopefully it affects

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:11.040
someone that is very close to you so you can get like a very tight feedback loop of

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:16.040
what you are building. And then try to solve it. And then use that as the guide of what

00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:21.040
to do, what to learn, what to focus on, what to do. In many cases it's just learning a

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:27.040
framework that is already there. You know, like why would I go and build a system to

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:31.040
control 3D printers instead of just like learning how to use Afterprint. In many

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:35.040
cases solving the problem is just like using the tool that is already there. But then in

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:39.040
some cases you end up figuring out that there's no tool and you just have to build it.

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:44.040
There's actually no link there on Formatter that can be super fast so you can run it

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:48.040
every time you just hit save. So then you just have to build it in Rust and create

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:54.040
Rust. Or like, you know, like there's always like this thing that you are trying to

00:52:54.040 --> 00:53:00.040
solve that is just not solved there yet. And that is what gives you the best value and

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:04.040
the best outcome. In many cases it can be just like, you know, contributing to

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:09.040
another open source project or building something new. But the thing is like for me

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:15.040
it's just like focusing on a problem that is important. That is what has worked for

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.040
me at least.

00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:18.040
Yeah, good advice.

00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:23.040
I would add to that that you really shouldn't try to, I mean you need to be really

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:27.040
passionate about the thing as well, right? It needs to be something that is really

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:33.040
something you're into, something that you will want to spend a lot of time on that is

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:38.040
actually not your working hours and such because otherwise the whole joke until this

00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:43.040
becomes anything viable, anything big enough to support you in any kind of way, even

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:47.040
if it's just being able to, I don't know, drink an additional coffee per week or

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:53.040
something, that will be a quite long slog and a lot of work and a lot of blood and

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:58.040
sweat and tears. And so you really need to be into this so that you want to do that.

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:03.040
If you are just in that for the end goal of, I don't know, becoming rich through

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:06.040
open source, which by the way will probably not work.

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:08.040
Only when.

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.040
I got rich.

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:23.040
Okay, that was unintentional. Then this will not work out. You need to focus on the

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:31.040
path to the goal and not the goal. A lot of people try to reach for the end goal

00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:35.040
before they actually are willing to actually walk the path. I also get this along.

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:39.040
I happen to be in the GitHub star program and I've had a lot of people ask me, how

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:43.040
do you become a GitHub star? And that is just the wrong question to ask. That's

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.040
just the same as it is. How do you become an open source maintainer of a popular

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:53.040
project? Like you just have to do whatever you are interested in. You have to do

00:54:53.040 --> 00:54:57.040
work and you have to be passionate about your work. And then maybe if you hit the

00:54:57.040 --> 00:55:02.040
right nerve, then that will happen and maybe it won't.

00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:08.040
Yeah. I think it's very interesting that none of us had a career path to where we

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:14.040
are now. We didn't set out to be where we are now. It just feels like we kind of

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:19.040
followed our own intuition and it worked out. Which means it's very difficult when

00:55:19.040 --> 00:55:22.040
someone asks me, well, how do you become an open source developer? How do you

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:28.040
start a company? I'm not quite sure. I can tell you my path to there. But it's

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:32.040
very hard for me to articulate to someone else.

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:36.040
I think there's a lot of luck involved as well. You have to do all this stuff and

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:40.040
then roll the dice. If it gets a six, then you can be successful.

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:44.040
Yeah. There's an element of luck, but it's kind of like a luck you make for

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:49.040
yourself. And it might take you to somewhere else or it might not. But as long

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:54.040
as you're passionate about it and you enjoy it, then great things will happen.

00:55:54.040 --> 00:56:01.040
Also, Will and Charlie, you both took some specific time on your own money to

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:06.040
really level up what you're working on, which is pretty brave. Not a lot of

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:11.040
people would say, I'm just going to spend my savings to work on this project and

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:16.040
see if I can make it go. You've earned some of that through taking that chance

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:19.040
and putting in that time and effort, I think.

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:23.040
For me, that didn't last very long. Because for three months, I was living on

00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:31.040
sponsorship. And then GCs came along and then there was like cash.

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:34.040
Then your world changed and you had to learn a whole new set of skills, I'm

00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.040
sure.

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:38.040
Yeah. And then I had a job and responsibilities.

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:45.040
I do feel really lucky that, like I said, this is my first time being a

00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:50.040
maintainer. And it was very clear to me quickly that for Ruff to have the pace

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:55.040
of development and the scope that it has, it had to be a full-time thing. That

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:59.040
was pretty obvious to me quickly. And I have a lot of respect for people who

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:02.040
have been maintainers for longer periods of time and in a way where it's not

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:06.040
their full-time job or they have to do it on the side. I think I haven't really

00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:11.040
been in that position. But it's already clear to me that that takes a lot of

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:15.040
dedication and commitment. So I feel very lucky that I get to work on open

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:18.040
source full-time. I know it's not all entirely luck, right? Like you were

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:22.040
saying. You increase your luck surface area and then opportunities come your

00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:28.040
way. But I do think it's just a very fortunate position that these kinds of

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:33.040
opportunities do exist. Because maintaining popular stuff is a lot. It's a

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:37.040
lot. I mean, there are privileges that come with it, 100%. But I mean, yeah,

00:57:37.040 --> 00:57:42.040
it's a ton. It's a lot of work and a lot of stress and a lot of responsibility.

00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:44.040
Well, and you don't necessarily have to start your own right away.

00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:47.040
I didn't have gray hair before this talk.

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.040
You don't necessarily have to start your own either. You could contribute to a

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:53.040
really popular one and kind of get into the scene. And, you know, like, Eric,

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:57.040
that sounds a little bit like your story. Like you were in the Django scene and

00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:00.040
then spun off from that what you guys are doing, right?

00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:03.040
Yeah, yeah, definitely. And, you know, part of an open source community and

00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:07.040
definitely kind of going to PyCon and just kind of being surrounded by those

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:11.040
people. Because that was always the -- it's very lonely work just to have an

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:16.040
inbox of GitHub issues and then no inbox thank yous. You know? And like going to

00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:19.040
conferences and that kind of stuff was really where you feel the appreciation

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:23.040
and you really kind of actually feel the value that you're providing as well as

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:27.040
just the stress of the things you're breaking.

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.040
Totally agree with that.

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:35.040
Absolutely. The conferences are great to really feel the appreciation rather

00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:37.040
than just the --

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.040
Yeah, they'll say thank you and then they'll give you a bug report. But at

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:42.040
least the thank you.

00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:45.040
While I'm talking to you, there was this -- could I just show you this one

00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.040
thing we're doing this hour?

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:52.040
I do think an interesting observation for me has been that like a year ago I

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:57.040
didn't really know anyone in Python open source. Like at all. And like I was a

00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:02.040
user of Python in my day job every day but I was not interacting with Python.

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:07.040
And in a year, yeah, now like Sebastian we've interacted a bunch. There's just

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:11.040
a lot of people that I've come to know and think of as like friends. So I think

00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:14.040
they're really -- especially if you're interested in getting involved and

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:19.040
putting in work, I really don't think there are significant barriers. And like

00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:24.040
you get out of it what you put in. So I think I've been very impressed with just

00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:28.040
how welcoming and friendly the community has been, especially other maintainers.

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:32.040
Yeah, absolutely. Talk to a lot of people who show up at PyCon and they're

00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:36.040
like I was really nervous to come here or I feel like I didn't fit in and they

00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:40.040
just had such a great experience. And I said, well, did you feel --

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:44.040
That was me. That was my first PyCon this year. I'd never been to a Python

00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:46.040
conference.

00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:49.040
That was such an amazing party.

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:52.040
That's true. I loved the Benihana.

00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:57.040
That was interesting. All right, guys. Well, I think we are pretty much out of

00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:00.040
time. Anyone want to have some final thoughts for listeners before we wrap it

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.040
up?

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.040
Go on, build some cool stuff.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:09.040
Who's brave enough?

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:12.040
How can maintain it today, I think.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:18.040
Give cake, not puppies. Let's leave it with that. Give cake, not puppies.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:22.040
And be really careful before you start a popular source project. It might take

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:28.040
over your life. If you want this, great. But if not, then --

01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:31.040
Yeah, careful what you wish for. You might get it.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:36.040
Gina, Sebastian, Eric, Will, Charlie, thank you all for being on the show.

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:38.040
This has been a ton of fun.

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:42.040
Thank you very much for having us. It's been an honor to be with these amazing

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.040
people. Thank you.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.040
I agree.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.040
Honestly, I had a blast hearing everyone's stories because I hadn't heard any of

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:51.040
this before. Thanks to everyone else and thanks, Michael.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.040
Yeah, you bet. Bye, all.
