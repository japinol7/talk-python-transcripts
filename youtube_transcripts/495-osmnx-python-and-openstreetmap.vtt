WEBVTT

00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.460
Jeff, welcome to Talk Python To Me.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.300
Thank you for having me.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.520
It's great to have you here.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.360
We're going to talk maps and consuming map data

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.760
and a lot of interesting research that you've done with the data.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.320
So you have a very cool project,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.760
OSMNX, OpenStreetMapNetworkX,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.640
that we're going to dive into,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.940
and it really makes all of this street and map data

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.480
super accessible to users of Python, right?

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.480
Yeah.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.040
Yeah. Excellent.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.520
I'm really looking forward to talking about that.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.920
Before we dive into it, though, just a quick introduction.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.820
Who are you?

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.780
Yeah, so my name is Jeff Boeing.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.320
I'm an assistant professor at the University of Southern California

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.780
here in Los Angeles.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.520
I'm in its Department of Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.760
And most of my research and teaching are around that intersection

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.560
of urban planning and spatial analysis.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.620
I did my PhD in city planning at UC Berkeley.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.240
And my focus is on urban data science.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.440
So using Python tools, usually open data,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.880
to try to understand cities and housing markets

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.920
and transportation networks and how people move through space

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.740
and how we can make our cities more resilient to natural disasters,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.580
which is relevant in L.A. this week.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.860
Also more equitable, nicer places to walk around

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.580
and basically just better for urban living.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.620
Okay.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.080
Well, that sounds like amazing, amazing research.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.220
It's probably interesting to live in L.A.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.200
as one of the bigger, crazier locations

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.540
in terms of traffic and congestion and population.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.140
It's not New York in terms of density,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.760
but it's probably its own special beast, I imagine.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.340
Yeah, it is.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.180
You know, L.A. is an ironic place

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.960
to be an urban planning professor

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.380
because it can be so frustrating

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.060
for a lot of our best practices in urban planning.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.060
But at the same time,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.460
there is no better place in the U.S.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.320
to be studying and trying to intervene

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.500
into some of these crises that urban planning has wrought.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.600
Yeah.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.220
Yeah, a lot of it was just,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.000
I imagine in the early days,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.100
just a free-for-all, right?

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.640
There was people, especially out in the West, right?

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.120
The U.S. West, people would just move out there

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.800
and there was not a whole lot going on.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.720
So what a city, just neighborhoods go that way

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.960
and not quite enough density

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.040
for a lot of public transit makes it challenging.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.420
And then they become huge cities,

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.100
but they're stuck with those consequences.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.880
Yeah, exactly.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.600
And it's hard to retrofit a city once it's built out

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.740
because those are people's homes and private properties

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.020
that you can't just cut from whole cloth,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.500
lay down a new city plan.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.440
Yeah, yeah.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.020
Are there cities out there

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.580
that are basically planned from scratch?

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.140
Yeah, there are.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.660
Places like Brasilia, the capital of Brazil,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.840
was a master-planned city.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.500
In the modernist era, mid-century city planning,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.300
where it's designed to look almost like the shape of an airplane

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.880
for the jet age, a modern city for the jet age.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.480
Amazing.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.160
But there's a wide range of how cities come to be.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.320
Some of them are very organic,

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.860
like you think old medieval cities

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.940
that just kind of formed over centuries.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.900
There are places like L.A. that built out very rapidly,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.280
or like in Chicago,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.060
all these straight lines following from these 19th century ideas

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.320
of rationality and orthogonal street networks.

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.580
And then there are these master-planned cities

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.960
where strong central leadership lets you lay it down

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.940
however you think is best.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.880
I imagine that how the cities are built

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.400
has a lot to do with the people who helped construct the city

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.440
or there in the early days,

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.960
how they perceived distance.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.360
People perceive distance in L.A.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.980
by how far can you go in a car in 20 minutes.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.780
The people perceived distance in Stuttgart,

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.160
how far can you walk?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.540
Maybe you can take a horse, potentially.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.040
Right.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.240
And that really probably changes things.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.580
Yeah.

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.880
You know, one way we talk about that idea

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.300
of the perception of distance

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.920
and how the urban form shapes up

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.540
is this idea of transportation technologies

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.620
in different eras.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.220
And in general,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.200
you really see something of a death of geography.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.600
That is, if you look at a 1990s suburb of Philadelphia

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.140
or of Los Angeles,

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.680
they look very similar to each other.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.780
You don't see that sort of local culture.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.840
What you see is really building around

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.480
the transportation technology

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.240
and design aesthetic of the era

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.500
rather than the local hands building the place up.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.760
And it's, you know,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.680
when cars are how you get around,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.660
you build a city designed for cars.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.280
Yeah.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.380
And then the cars get to be huge SUVs

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.140
and they still don't fit.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.820
All right.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.500
Let's talk.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.120
You have this really cool visualization,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.920
which I'm going to link to in the show notes

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.480
called City Street Orientations Around the World.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.100
And it's got some pretty wild graphics.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.480
You want to tell people about this

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:29.920
and kind of try to describe it for folks listening?

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:31.200
Yeah.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.420
So what these show is the orientation

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.460
of your city streets.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.260
By orientation, we mean on a compass.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.620
Like, do they point north, south, east, west?

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.180
Are they off that north, south, east, west orientation?

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.400
Or do your streets point more chaotically

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.420
in all directions around the compass?

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.260
Like there isn't a more consistent orientation.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.380
So to visualize these,

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.900
I used what's basically just a histogram,

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.300
but it's a polar histogram.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.980
So where a normal histogram

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.540
will count your observations

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.000
across some set of bins,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.480
for a polar histogram,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.900
we've wrapped those bins

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.100
around the circle of a compass

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.620
so that each bin represents 10 degrees

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.860
around the compass.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.520
And there's 36 bins total

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.480
for 360 degrees around the circle.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.900
And then the length of each of the bars

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.960
in those bins represents the frequency

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.620
of streets pointing in that direction

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.560
in the city.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.300
So in a place like Chicago

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.300
or Beijing on screen here,

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.460
most of the streets point north, south, east, west.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:42.480
And what that tells us

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.420
is it's kind of grid-like.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.820
And this is common

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.260
in a lot of cities around the world.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.200
Even a lot of pre-modern cities

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.160
would still orient themselves

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.960
generally north, south, east, west,

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.820
just based on patterns

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.940
where the sun was rising and setting.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.540
Yeah, I'm super surprised to see,

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:00.740
for example, Barcelona is pretty,

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.320
not north, south, but it's 90 degrees.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.320
Yeah.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.700
Yeah, so in Barcelona,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.900
you see that 19th century

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.740
and early 20th century

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.660
ishampla development.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.340
So around medieval old Barcelona,

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.140
Ildefon Serrida laid out

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.300
his grand city plan

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.500
that is fairly grid-like around it.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.580
You can really see that here.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.720
Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.120
For people listening,

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.640
some of them look like

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.620
airplane four-blade propellers

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.820
and some look maybe like boat propellers,

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.660
like really dense.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.060
But yeah, it's quite wild

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.180
to get a quick look.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.220
Do we have LA in there?

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.960
We must, right?

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.660
I have LA in the big one.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.780
If you scroll down,

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:44.220
we have American cities.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.740
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.120
Okay.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.640
That's a pretty stark contrast.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.340
It's like all of them

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:51.120
are propeller looking

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.280
other than Boston

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.860
and interestingly, Charlotte.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:54.980
Boston is a city.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:55.800
Yeah, really interesting.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:57.380
Yeah, but Charlotte doesn't feel

00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.620
like a city like that to me.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.580
But what do I do?

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.340
Yeah, so Boston is kind of

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.260
one of those pre-modern,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.620
say, American cities.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.900
And its street orientation

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:08.440
looks like that

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.500
for a couple of reasons.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.140
One, Boston is an agglomeration

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.680
of multiple smaller towns

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.960
over several centuries.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.740
And each of them had grids

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:17.460
to some extent,

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.960
but they didn't all face

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.580
the same way.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.940
So they all got merged together.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.340
And then it has a lot of hills

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.500
that made it harder to build,

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.560
especially in the early days.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.540
And it really predated

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.220
America's obsession with grids.

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:32.880
Charlotte is kind of the opposite.

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.160
It's late 20th century,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.000
the sort of winding streets

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and cul-de-sacs

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.560
to make up those,

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.280
you know, arterial roads

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.160
and then sort of secluded

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.620
in the center super blocks

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:45.160
of subdivisions.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:45.900
Nice.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.820
Well, I'm happy to see

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:47.860
that Portland, where I live,

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.660
is like a perfect

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.160
propeller blade shape.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.280
You know, in our town,

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.940
you have northeast,

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.540
northwest, southeast,

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.480
and then street numbers

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.380
like northeast 120th Street,

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:00.860
right?

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:01.740
And it just screams.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:03.960
We're on a perpendicular

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.340
north-south-east-west grid.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.060
And it definitely shows up here.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.140
And so this is some of the stuff

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.260
that you came up with,

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.380
OSMNX?

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.700
Yeah.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.260
So I used OSMNX

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.460
to build all of these

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.100
street network models

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.800
from OpenStreetMap data.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.640
And then OSMNX

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.800
has built into it

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.040
a visualization module

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.540
that creates these kind

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.720
of polar histograms

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.940
to understand how streets

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:30.520
are oriented.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:31.360
awesome.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.460
It's super interesting.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:33.980
Let's,

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.320
and it's like,

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.480
it communicates to you

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.460
just immediately

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.080
as you look at it.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:39.400
It's great.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.360
Let's start by talking

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.460
about OpenStreetMap.

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:45.740
This is the backing data,

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.460
obviously,

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.840
the important backing data

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.300
of your library.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:50.760
So what's the origin

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:51.840
of OpenStreetMap?

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:53.660
Yeah,

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.020
so OpenStreetMap

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.180
started maybe 20 years ago

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:57.760
or so.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.060
For folks who haven't

00:09:59.060 --> 00:09:59.740
seen it before,

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.620
I often describe it

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.320
as being akin

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.620
to Google Maps

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.440
meets Wikipedia.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.900
So it's a worldwide

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.780
mapping project

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.700
with global coverage.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.160
Anyone can edit

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.420
or contribute to it.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.020
There is some editorial

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.780
oversight as well

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.840
to validate those edits.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.500
But what's cool

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.740
about OpenStreetMap

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:24.480
is that its data license

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.580
allows you to pull data

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:27.500
from it.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.040
So unlike,

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.880
say,

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:30.600
Google Maps,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.760
which is fairly limited

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.220
in what all it can draw,

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.600
you can really pull

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.200
all of these features

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.440
from OpenStreetMap.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.000
And if you look,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.020
if you just zoom in

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.240
on one of these cities here.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:40.600
Yeah,

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.460
let's go to Riverside.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:41.800
Yeah.

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.760
Yeah,

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.060
there's surface streets,

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.140
rail lines,

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.580
building footprints,

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:47.600
parks,

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.540
train stations,

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.200
often grocery stores,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:50.920
restaurants,

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.880
public schools,

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.180
all this stuff

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.300
we're interested in

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.460
from an urban planning

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.200
perspective.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.480
Yeah.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.600
Oh,

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.020
it's really interesting.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:01.980
And you can add

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.280
in additional layers

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.460
like cycling maps

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:07.880
or transportation maps

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.840
or topology maps,

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.580
topological maps,

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.480
all sorts of interesting

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.260
things here.

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.460
Yeah,

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:15.140
exactly.

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.020
And it really lets you

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.760
kind of hone in

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.080
on the specific

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.920
characteristics of the city

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.380
that you're interested in.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.060
And there's a humanitarian

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.940
layer that you can see.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:27.360
And this has been

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.220
one of the big uses

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.640
of OpenStreetMap

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.060
now for

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.600
15 years or so.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.040
often when there is

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.340
a disaster

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.800
in a less developed

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:40.380
country,

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.300
humanitarian aid

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.640
organizations will go in

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:44.760
and use OpenStreetMap

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.000
and contribute to it

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.140
to create

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.140
kind of a

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:49.300
digital layer

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:50.100
of the facts

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.760
on the ground.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.680
So the Haiti earthquake

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:53.460
a few years back

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:54.920
was a primary example

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:55.440
of that

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.240
where it helped them

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.000
understand

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.520
where urbanization

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.100
was,

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:00.480
where there were

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.120
water pumps,

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.540
toilets,

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:02.280
and so forth,

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:02.700
the kind of things

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:03.800
that people need

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.740
but aren't

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:05.620
well mapped

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.680
often in these

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.620
informal settlements.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.640
Yeah.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.280
Oh, it's

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.880
amazing.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.600
We have,

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:11.980
you know,

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:12.420
I think

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.060
everyone was amazed

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.320
when Google Maps

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.900
came out,

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.260
right?

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:17.800
Before then,

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.220
we had MapQuest

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:19.940
and all those things.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:20.700
You'd have big little

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:21.180
up arrow,

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:21.660
up arrow,

00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.120
right arrow

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.280
to like pull in tiles

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:23.800
of the world

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.020
and,

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.260
you know,

00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.680
Google Maps

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.640
and the worldview

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.140
that they had.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:29.800
What was that product

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:30.120
called?

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:30.660
Remember?

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.560
Where you could

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.160
kind of fly,

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.160
it was like a 3D thing.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:34.900
You could kind of fly

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.080
around in the early days

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.920
but it was the same

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.460
basic data,

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:37.720
I think.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.420
Anyway,

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.340
when that stuff came out,

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:39.700
it was like,

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.060
wow,

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:40.780
this stuff is,

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.320
you can now know

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:42.760
about the world.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.220
You can say,

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.400
where did that road go?

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.080
I never went down.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.020
You could just follow it

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:47.200
and see or go to

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.000
Street View or whatever.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.340
but a lot of that

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.400
is locked behind

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.540
however Google

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.560
wants you to use it,

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.420
right?

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.460
And it's not

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:57.260
super accessible

00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.760
and so having

00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.780
something like this

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.460
where people can contribute,

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.400
especially if they care

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.020
about their neighborhood,

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:03.300
right?

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:03.760
A lot of this,

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.180
people are contributing

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:05.960
back into

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.540
OpenStreetMap data.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.760
Yeah,

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.320
exactly.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.840
Yeah,

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.600
so the nice thing

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.320
with this is that

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.680
it really is much more

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.200
in that open source,

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.720
open data model

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.180
of the world

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:17.940
which means we can do

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:18.840
open science

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.480
with it,

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.060
citizen science with it.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:21.840
People,

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.300
you know,

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:22.960
who just notice

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.140
that stuff is missing

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.020
in their own community,

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.480
you're able to fix it.

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:26.920
It's no longer

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.100
that frustration of,

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:28.660
well,

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:29.340
when will Google

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:30.620
get this thing right?

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:30.920
Hey,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.440
we have this new highway

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.060
that was built

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:33.880
outside my town.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.280
When's it going to show up?

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:35.680
I mean,

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.160
it's up to you

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:36.800
because you can make it

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:37.840
show up later today.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.320
There is a drawback

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:39.960
to that though.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.880
The drawback

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.340
is you get

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:41.880
what we call

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.080
sampling biases.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.420
That is,

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:44.980
you tend to see

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.040
more coverage

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.100
in places

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:47.720
where

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.800
people tend

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.360
to contribute

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:49.780
more.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:50.600
And those things

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.320
tend to be correlated

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:52.800
with demographic

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.600
characteristics.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:54.580
Men contribute

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:55.240
more than women.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.560
Higher income

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:57.100
places

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:57.780
more than

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:58.360
lower income

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:58.840
places

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.020
just from a

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:00.540
resourcing

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.640
perspective.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:02.960
And so one of the

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.700
challenges we face

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:04.360
as researchers

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.900
using OpenStreetMap

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:07.300
data for our

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.940
analytics work

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.120
is keeping those

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:10.680
in mind

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.280
because it's hard

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:11.940
to do comparative

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:12.480
analysis.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.740
If you don't know,

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:14.320
it's because the

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.320
infrastructure is actually

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.380
different in two places

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:17.300
places or because

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.420
it's been digitized

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:18.860
to a different

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.940
extent in two

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.360
places.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:20.760
Right,

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:21.120
right,

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:21.420
right.

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.080
Just maybe

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.880
higher fidelity

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.020
information might

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.300
skew some analysis

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:27.060
one way or another,

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:27.380
right?

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:28.600
That's right,

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.100
exactly.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.440
And it tends to work

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.300
pretty well comparatively

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.460
for stuff like roads,

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.240
streets,

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.380
whereas things like

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.260
pedestrian footpaths

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:39.520
or fresh food markets

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.220
might be well digitized

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:41.880
in San Francisco

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.440
in Portland,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.300
but probably not

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.680
say in a small town

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.200
in India or Indonesia,

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.180
let alone like a

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.040
suburb of Des Moines,

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:49.420
Iowa.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.500
Yeah,

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:51.000
yeah,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.340
absolutely.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:52.720
One of the apps

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.800
that I use a lot

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.020
is OnX.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.300
Do you know OnX?

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.140
Mm-hmm.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.580
Yeah,

00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.300
OnX is cool.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:14:59.680
You can,

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.260
I do a lot of off-road

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.040
motorcycle riding

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.560
and it'll show you

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.780
all the little trails

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.260
and stuff,

00:15:05.260 --> 00:15:05.660
but,

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:06.760
you know,

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.660
someone's got to go

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:08.420
and enter all that

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:08.880
information.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.140
and so some places

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.740
are super well mapped

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.780
and others are not

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.600
on the map at all,

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:15.840
but,

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:17.020
yeah,

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.120
I imagine they probably

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:18.920
get some of their data

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.280
from OpenStreetMap as well,

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:20.800
though I haven't been

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.360
able to tell.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.360
Yeah,

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:22.900
it's a good question.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:24.200
A lot of people

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.100
downstream do use

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:26.960
OpenStreetMap data

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.300
because of its quality

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:28.940
and accessibility.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.340
Yeah,

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.500
Mark out in the audience

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.020
is asking,

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:32.700
you know,

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.780
is there some kind

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:34.420
of mobile app

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.400
that kind of gives you

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.800
access to the

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.020
OpenStreetMap?

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.340
data,

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:41.340
kind of like Google Maps.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:41.500
Yeah,

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.840
there are some mobile apps

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.940
for it.

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.840
I don't use them.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:48.780
It has some challenges

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:49.280
with routing

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.600
because it is publicly

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.720
editable.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.100
Sometimes there'll be

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:53.900
little breaks

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:54.620
in the connections

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.560
where it's not digitized

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.600
quite right,

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.540
but there are routing apps.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.240
You could replace,

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:00.440
say,

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.020
Google Maps

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:01.620
on your phone

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:02.420
with OpenStreetMap

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.540
and you can route with it.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.000
It works particularly well

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.040
in big cities

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:06.940
in places like Europe

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.360
and the U.S.,

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.520
less so in small rural areas

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.800
or in less developed countries.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.240
Yeah,

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.620
yeah,

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.640
the OnX thing is

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:16.160
it doesn't really route you,

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.840
but it shows you on a map

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.440
and it shows you

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.220
where you go on it

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.680
and if you choose

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.820
to stay on the path

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:22.680
then it'll really help you,

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.520
but it doesn't really say,

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.100
you can't say,

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.880
give me directions.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.120
At least not when you're off-road.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:31.760
If you're on-road,

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:32.740
maybe it'll fall back

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.500
to something that works,

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:34.780
but yeah,

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:35.120
amazing.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.840
So what's the licensing story

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.820
behind all this data?

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.920
Like how,

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.300
the name probably

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.140
gives a lot of it away,

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.120
OpenStreetMap,

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.060
but how is this data usable?

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.040
What can people do with it?

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.060
Yeah,

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:48.560
so it's basically usable

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:51.220
for non-commercial purposes

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.320
with attribution.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.560
So for example,

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.140
as researchers,

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.360
when we are using these data,

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.000
we just need to attribute

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.140
where it came from,

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:01.800
OpenStreetMap

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.200
and its contributors.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.740
And I ended up including

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.920
that license information

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.480
somewhere on the readme

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.980
for OSMNX

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.640
because I think a lot of time

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.540
people will look over

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.540
these underlying data sources

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.300
and tools

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.460
when they're using

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.520
these kind of downstream,

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.260
downstream tools

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.320
and apps.

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.800
So because of that,

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.340
I just wanted to,

00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:28.620
you know,

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:28.980
call it,

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.120
yeah,

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.200
you can see it on screen here.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:30.760
So I mentioned

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.840
OpenStreetMap's

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.440
open data license

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.980
requires that derivative works

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.920
provide proper attribution,

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:38.400
which is really nice

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.680
because it's a very easy thing

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.500
to do for the cornucopia

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.320
of data that they make available.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.440
Yeah,

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:44.940
that's amazing.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:46.220
If I wanted to build

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.820
a commercial product,

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.420
I wanted to build

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.620
Onyx squared or whatever

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.440
where I could have people

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.100
drive around and use that

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.220
and map it

00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:55.060
and make notes

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.120
and maybe contribute back.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.260
Do you know what the story,

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:58.540
I mean,

00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.660
obviously not a lawyer,

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:00.240
right?

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.380
But what's the,

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:02.920
would people be able to

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.060
do that

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:05.640
or is there a paid API

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.400
or how does it work?

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.440
It's a good question.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.900
So I know in practice

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:09.620
people can

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.180
because I see commercial tools

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.200
that use OpenStreetMap data

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:12.880
all the time.

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.640
I don't know the details though

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.620
because one of the nice things

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.500
about being in academia

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:18.740
is you end up being so divorced

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.820
from the commercial world

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.520
that I don't have to worry about that.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.440
Yeah,

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.280
that's,

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.520
that's pretty good,

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:25.700
right?

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.420
Just do,

00:18:26.420 --> 00:18:27.180
do your research,

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:28.380
answer interesting questions

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.680
and follow the lead,

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:29.880
right?

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.100
Those are the benefits.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:31.400
Yeah,

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:32.280
it comes with drawbacks

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:33.080
but those are the benefits.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:34.460
Yeah,

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.500
I'm aware of some of the drawbacks

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:35.900
as well,

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:36.320
for sure.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.740
all right,

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:38.020
well,

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.620
so that is the foundation

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.800
of this project,

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.980
OSM NX.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.320
Tell us about your project.

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:47.280
Yeah,

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:47.720
so

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.980
OSM NX is a Python package

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.660
that lets you interact

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.300
with OpenStreetMap's APIs

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.260
to make it really easy

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:57.280
to download data

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.640
and build models

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.500
or a data frame

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.920
of those data.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.200
so the two main things

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:05.840
that it does

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.180
is it can create

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:08.580
a graph model

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.820
that is a model

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:10.980
of a network

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:12.320
like streets

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.600
or rails

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.460
or highways

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.520
or anything else

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.100
or you can create

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.220
a geodata frame

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:18.800
that's kind of

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.020
a spatialized version

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.360
of a pandas data frame

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.460
using geopandas

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.480
of OpenStreetMap features.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.640
So that's all the stuff

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.360
in OpenStreetMap.

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.900
It could be points,

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.580
lines,

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.420
polygons.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.440
It could be, you know,

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.280
traffic signals

00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:33.100
or parks

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.060
or schools

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.120
or roads.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.060
But you can download

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:37.800
either of those

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.440
and then do whatever

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.440
it is you want to do

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:40.820
with them.

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:42.240
And OSM NX

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.500
has some other stuff

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.020
built in.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:45.040
so it has a simple

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.180
routing engine

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:46.780
built in,

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.620
some visualization

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.000
tools.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:50.940
You can work

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:51.620
with elevation

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:52.480
so that you can

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.140
figure out

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:54.980
street grades,

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.660
particularly relevant,

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:57.240
for example,

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.200
if you're a cyclist

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.160
and you're trying

00:19:59.160 --> 00:19:59.560
to choose

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.560
a shortest path

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.400
that maybe minimizes

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:02.540
those grades

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:03.220
and so forth.

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.520
even for cars,

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:05.880
you know,

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.620
Google started

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:08.360
offering a

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:09.400
this path

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.200
saves,

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.700
uses the least fuel

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.740
or in my case

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.680
the least electricity,

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.640
whatever,

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.940
whatever you put into it

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:17.060
to make it go.

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:19.440
That's also,

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:19.960
you know,

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.160
that's uses like

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:21.880
that would be interesting.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:23.900
Yeah,

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:24.480
exactly.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:24.780
Yeah,

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:25.140
I mean,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.380
kind of superficially

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:27.200
we always imagine

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.780
that our shortest path

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:29.340
to get somewhere

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.200
is the one that minimizes

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.220
our travel time.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.060
But in reality,

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:33.820
there are a lot

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:34.260
of other things

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:34.880
we try to minimize

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.060
including fuel consumption

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.140
or for pedestrians.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.000
Empirically,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.300
we know that people

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.420
will take longer routes

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.840
if it's a nicer route.

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:43.680
We're not trying to

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.740
shave off a minute

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:45.200
to walk,

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:45.520
you know,

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.800
along the arterial road

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.220
with the aluminum

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.420
to melt right next to it.

00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:51.660
You go through the fence

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.100
by that old abandoned factory

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:53.620
back here

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.560
and you go straight across.

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:55.800
It'll be great.

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:56.540
You'll save a minute.

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:56.760
Like,

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:57.000
yeah,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:57.780
I'll go the long way.

00:20:57.780 --> 00:20:59.320
Exactly.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.540
Amazing.

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:01.840
Okay.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.900
Yeah,

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:03.660
super fun.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:04.260
And as part

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.100
of those visualizations,

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.780
can you draw maps?

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:07.520
Can you?

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.520
You can.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:09.780
Yeah.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.580
So it has

00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:11.920
some mapping

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:12.780
capabilities.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.640
You can also

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.860
plot routes on it.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:17.540
It ties in

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.400
to a folium package,

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.740
which is a Python package

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:22.480
to develop

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.340
leaflet

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:24.220
JavaScript

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.280
web maps.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:25.920
Okay.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.240
So you can do

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.280
interactive web maps

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:27.680
from it.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.360
And then on top

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.620
of OSMNX,

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.060
there's a cool

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.300
downstream package

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.460
called pretty maps

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.420
that I'm not affiliated

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:37.920
with,

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.120
but does really nice,

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.600
aesthetically pleasing

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.580
mapping.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.700
It's really customizable

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:45.780
and really cool.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:47.100
Okay.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.460
Do you have a gallery

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:48.940
or something?

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.760
I do, yeah.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:51.740
So if you scroll up

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.180
a little bit,

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:52.740
there's a link

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.440
to the examples gallery.

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.720
It's on GitHub.

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:57.000
Okay.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.580
OSMNX examples.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:58.740
Oh,

00:21:58.740 --> 00:21:59.880
you can pull up

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.440
different notebooks,

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:00.900
huh?

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.800
Yeah,

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.300
exactly.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.320
So each notebook

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:03.840
kind of covers

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.720
a different theme

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:05.400
of analyses

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:05.800
that would be

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.500
commonly done

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:07.760
with OSMNX.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:08.460
Oh,

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:08.780
nice.

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.000
Yeah,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:09.580
that's really cool.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:10.080
And people can just

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:10.660
pull up the notebook

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:11.220
and see how it works.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:11.880
What one do you think

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:12.820
is a good representative

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:13.720
one to maybe like

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.180
get a sense

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:14.900
of how to work with it?

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:17.400
So we count from zero

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.580
because we're in the Python world.

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:19.280
So notebook zero,

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.060
zero is a good place

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:21.700
to start.

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.380
Yeah.

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.220
It kind of steps

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:23.940
through some

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:25.280
of the basic functionality

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.380
that most users

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:28.580
would be interested

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:29.520
in starting with.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.660
Sure.

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:31.300
Okay.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:32.660
Yeah.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.500
So people can download

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:34.160
these notebooks

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.180
in the examples

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.060
repository,

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.160
which I'll link to.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.280
Yeah,

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:39.720
that's really good.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:39.760
Yeah,

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.200
exactly.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.600
So there's a getting started

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.740
guide in the documentation

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.940
after kind of reading

00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.640
through that.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.760
That examples gallery

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.620
is a really good way

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.640
to just kind of get

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:50.440
a sense of code

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.240
that you can copy

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.120
and paste to get started.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.080
Okay.

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.140
Excellent.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.800
And 5,000 GitHub stars,

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.000
almost 1,000 forks.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:58.520
You know,

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.780
that's quite a bit of traction.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:00.300
Congratulations.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.820
Yeah,

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:02.480
thanks.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:02.740
I mean,

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:03.280
it's weird.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:03.920
This is very much

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.400
my side hustle,

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.320
but it's also really

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.720
been a labor of love

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.840
for a long time now.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.240
There is no reward

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.560
in academia

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.160
for creating

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.520
open source packages.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.880
I think if you explain

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:17.720
it very carefully

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.080
to academic power brokers,

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.740
they say,

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.760
that makes sense.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:22.320
That's great.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.300
That's a good contribution.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.600
But prima facie,

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.620
that doesn't mean anything.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.180
Yeah,

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:27.680
it's really,

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.260
it's tough to put it

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:30.640
on a 10-year application,

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:30.960
right?

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:31.900
Yeah,

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.020
it makes it sound

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.200
like you're wasting

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:34.660
your time

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.420
and you don't understand

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:35.960
what you're supposed

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:36.660
to be doing

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:37.620
with your time.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:39.280
But you understand

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.100
the research is so easy now.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.020
Yeah.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:42.900
Yeah.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.220
I mean,

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.240
that's really how that started.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:45.860
I thought I was going

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:46.700
to be able to do this research

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.800
without having to create

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:49.160
my own tool,

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:49.820
but it turned out

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:50.820
I was not able to.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:51.960
Interesting.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.700
What was your background

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.200
on programming

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:53.720
at that point?

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:55.960
Yeah,

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:58.160
so my undergrad

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.520
and master's degree,

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.380
I did computer systems

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:03.100
and information systems.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.420
I worked in the private sector

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:07.100
for a few years

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:07.720
and decided to go back

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.860
to school for my PhD

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.000
in urban planning.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.520
But when I was coming

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:11.900
into that,

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.220
I was pitching myself

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:14.800
as the sort of like

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.420
data science analytics

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:17.480
kind of person

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.060
in that world,

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.040
which was starting

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.080
to get kind of hot

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:21.540
at that time.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.440
So it ended up

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.500
being a nice fit.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.140
And when I started

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:26.900
my dissertation,

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.420
I had this dissertation proposal

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.440
that was,

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:30.900
you know,

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.760
very,

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.400
very nice.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.060
It's kind of big,

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:33.980
grand proposal.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.500
I ended up only doing

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.580
the first chapter of it

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.600
for my entire dissertation

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.760
because of how these things

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:39.980
expand to fill space.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.160
And when I pitched my proposal

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.980
to my dissertation committee,

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.180
there were a lot of assumptions

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:47.000
about the tools

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.560
that were out there.

00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:47.720
You know,

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:48.460
I knew OpenStreetMap

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:49.120
was out there.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.680
I'd seen there were some tools

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.160
to download

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.160
and work with data from it.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:53.200
So I was pretty sure

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.700
we'd be able to create

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.260
a nice mathematical graph model

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.700
of OpenStreetMap data

00:24:58.700 --> 00:24:59.420
automatically.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.140
As I started

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:03.160
on my first week

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.520
of making that happen,

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:05.040
I realized

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.300
that the tool did not exist.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:07.600
And in fact,

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.020
it was profoundly difficult

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:10.100
to get data

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.220
from OpenStreetMap

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.820
if you wanted to filter it.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:13.120
Like,

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:14.620
I just want pedestrian paths,

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.420
not everything.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:16.540
Right.

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:17.320
I just want,

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:17.840
you know,

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.980
drivable streets,

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:19.960
not everything else.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.000
And so the first year

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:22.900
of my dissertation work

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:23.780
was creating

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:26.040
the first version

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.640
of OSM and X accordingly.

00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.920
So you must have grants

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.580
and stuff

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:33.840
for your research

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:35.400
as academics do.

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.180
How much time

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:39.060
are you allowed

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:39.700
to sort of bring

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:40.280
some of that

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:41.580
into, you know,

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:42.300
adding features

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:43.280
back to this project?

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:45.440
Yeah, you know,

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:46.540
back to the benefits

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:47.260
of academia.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.480
The nice thing is

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.520
as long as you get

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.360
what they want to see done,

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.240
as long as those outputs

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:52.700
are there,

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.080
your time is really

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.300
completely your own, right?

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:56.480
So you teach a couple classes,

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.260
you have to publish

00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:58.120
a few papers a year.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:58.740
Other than that,

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.360
you're free to do whatever.

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.200
So I do get grants

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:02.780
that help me fund

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.120
my graduate students.

00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.180
Ironically,

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.300
it's very hard

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:08.420
to get grants

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:09.460
to do this kind of

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:11.500
open source software,

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.320
open commons development.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:15.380
everyone talks about it

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.600
and especially grant funders

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.260
know how much

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.520
we all use this stuff

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.260
and they really like it

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.960
but it just doesn't get funded.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.900
So what you have to do

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.520
is you have to kind of

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.700
hack it in

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:27.080
or sideload it,

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:27.520
I guess,

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.760
into your grants

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:29.900
where the grant

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:30.280
will answer

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.460
this empirical question

00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:32.280
that's near and dear

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.180
to the funder's heart.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.780
But to do that,

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:35.800
we have this tool building

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.060
phase for six months

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.360
to be able to unlock

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.780
the analytics for it.

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:41.600
and so that's really

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.480
how a lot of the features

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.740
and a lot of the modules

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:45.540
have been added

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.300
to OSMNX over time.

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:48.520
There's this new project

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.180
I ought to do

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.660
so we'll just build it

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:51.480
into the package.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.020
Right.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.400
We need to be able

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.320
to answer new questions

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.280
so we got to have

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.640
new ways to get

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.280
to the data, yeah?

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.960
Yeah, exactly.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.340
And it is poorly

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.660
incentivized in academia

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.420
but academia

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:05.180
has really been home

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.540
to a lot of open source

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.420
tool development,

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.780
especially niche tools,

00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:10.040
you know,

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.640
from stuff like AstroPy

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.560
for the astronomers

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.480
and astrophysicists

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.220
to things like PySAL,

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.640
the spatial analysis library

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.340
in Python,

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:20.420
but a lot of things

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:20.960
that academics

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.440
have kind of been

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.520
at the forefront of,

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.400
but for us,

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.480
it's always a side hustle.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:25.700
Right.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.680
Stuff with biology,

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.420
psychology,

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:28.760
a lot of the sciences,

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:29.280
I imagine.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.240
Yeah.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.920
working on open source

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:34.020
projects like this

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:34.700
feels to me

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.800
very much like

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.100
the concept of funding

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.700
basic science,

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:41.960
right?

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:42.660
Not funding,

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.980
we need to solve

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:44.560
this problem

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.280
so we can create a bomb

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:46.960
or new energy

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.620
or go to space,

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:49.460
but we're just doing it

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.280
because we need to understand

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.080
the science better

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.020
and it'll help us

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.120
then apply it

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.320
eventually maybe

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.180
at some point,

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:57.480
right?

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.400
Same sort of thing here,

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.000
like if these exist,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.140
it will supercharge

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.260
the urban planning space

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.300
to a huge degree,

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.640
but getting people

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.300
to fund it

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:10.420
or to like care about

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.400
helping build that up,

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.780
I imagine it's a little bit

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:15.420
frustrating.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.880
No, that's exactly it.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.060
I mean,

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.580
the way I talk about it

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.280
is it really is

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.840
a sort of basic science work

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.640
that everyone takes

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.240
for granted

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:24.940
as though these things

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.380
just exist, right?

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.600
That this tool

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.620
just exists,

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:29.040
we don't know

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:29.860
where it comes from,

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:30.900
it has an API

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.420
that API just exists

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.280
and it really kind of

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.280
obscures

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.060
all of these human decisions

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:39.060
and social structures

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:39.860
and processes

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:40.720
and institutions

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.640
that make it difficult

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.420
or make other things easy

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.800
and really shape

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:46.480
what we end up

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:47.820
being able to work with.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.640
Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.460
Well,

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.280
someday,

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:53.900
maybe you can put down,

00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:54.960
yeah,

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.220
I only wrote two papers

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.200
but I have 10,000

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:58.800
get up stars

00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.260
so

00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:01.780
here's your tenure

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.920
assignment,

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:03.320
you know?

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.320
This is the future,

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.940
I'm there for it.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:08.840
It's a race

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:09.500
between whether

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.800
ChatGPT overtakes

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.720
all of that stuff

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.880
or you get there

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.360
and people,

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:13.800
I don't know,

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.980
that's all different.

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.900
We can talk about that later.

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:18.900
Let's talk about

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.240
the Overpass API though.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.740
That's the way

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:22.440
that you get data

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.000
from

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.100
OpenStreetMap.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:26.660
What is this?

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:27.880
Yeah,

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:28.480
so

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.100
the Overpass API

00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:32.720
is another open source

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.980
tool

00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.900
that lets us query

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.640
OpenStreetMap's database

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.580
and download stuff,

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:40.020
basically,

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:40.760
any

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:43.500
of OpenStreetMap's features.

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:44.640
So

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:46.560
what's nice about Overpass

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.040
is that there's

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:48.920
some public instances

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.220
that you can just

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:51.980
query as a web API.

00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.060
You can also host it locally

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.800
if you want to work around

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.500
throttling limits,

00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.040
rate limits.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.880
Challenge with

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.760
the Overpass API,

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.840
you can see a little bit

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.640
of it here on screen

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.260
is that the Overpass QL,

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:08.260
it's query language,

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:11.120
can be really hard

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.360
to work with

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.940
to do complex stuff.

00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.240
So this is a fairly simple one.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:15.640
On screen,

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.100
we can see there's a bounding box

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.720
with some lat-long coordinates

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.000
to explain where we want

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.700
to download data from.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.300
The output will be

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:25.740
in JSON format.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:26.820
The server timeout

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.020
is 90 seconds.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.220
Big queries

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.700
can take a long time to run.

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.840
And then we're querying here

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.480
for way elements.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.340
So way would be

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.720
a line feature

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.760
in OpenStreetMap.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.700
Any line,

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:41.880
it could be street,

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.520
it could also be

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.020
the building footprints

00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:46.480
boundary line.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.400
I see,

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:48.440
property lines

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.860
or zoning

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:51.760
or whatever, right?

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.960
Yeah, exactly.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.200
Anything represented

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.900
as a line.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:57.240
And so we get that

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:57.800
back out,

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.420
it'll be kicked out

00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.600
as a JSON.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.740
And what OSMNX does

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.280
is it works

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.020
with this Overpass API

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.380
to try to automate

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.620
some of these queries.

00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.260
so rather than having

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:08.040
to write the query

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:08.500
yourself,

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.160
download the data,

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.460
and then convert

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:12.960
that raw OpenStreetMap data

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.560
into a useful data format,

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.220
like drop it into GeoPandas

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.900
or into a NetworkX graph,

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.940
it assembles all of that

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:20.880
under the hood.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.460
It's open source.

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:23.340
It's well-documented.

00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.420
I have a few peer-reviewed

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.200
articles about

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.320
the exact process.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.620
So we don't all

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:28.940
have to reinvent the wheel

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:29.560
trying to work

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:30.120
with this data

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:30.860
because none of this

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.760
is automatic.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:32.420
And in fact,

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.360
you know,

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.540
10 plus years ago,

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.460
people were very laboriously

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:37.140
having to write

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:38.580
these long scripts.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.580
You know what I'm going to do?

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:40.060
I'm going to get

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.000
a grad student

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:41.940
and it's going to be

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.300
their job for the summer

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.260
to convert this

00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:46.320
to Excel or MATLAB

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:46.640
for me.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.240
Something like that?

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.040
Exactly, yeah.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.620
Grad students are great.

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.060
But what's greater,

00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:52.600
I think,

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:53.700
is having one or two lines

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:54.140
of code

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.260
to replace your grad student

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:55.520
for this year.

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:56.700
100% and let them do

00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:57.520
meaningful work

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.760
that they also like, right?

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.560
Yeah, that's the whole thing.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.180
Yeah, yeah,

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:02.640
it's fantastic.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.800
As I look at this

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:04.560
and think about this,

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.560
it feels to me

00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:07.620
like OSM and X

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:09.540
is a little bit

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.840
like an ORM

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.180
is to SQL

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.540
and databases, right?

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:13.860
Like,

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:14.340
yeah,

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.360
let's you,

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.120
you think more

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.600
in Python language

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.920
and concepts

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.600
and don't worry

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.480
about the query syntax

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.220
and the data

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.500
and all that kind of stuff.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.680
Is that a reasonable analogy?

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:26.560
Yeah, that's a good way

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:27.200
to put it.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.480
And the goal

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:29.940
for doing something

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:30.620
like that

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:32.620
is to try to democratize

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:33.880
doing some of these analyses.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.520
You know,

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.780
OpenStreetMap data

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.860
are really amazing.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.880
Overpass is an amazing resource,

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:39.740
but it's really hard

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:40.440
to work with

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.260
unless you have

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:43.120
some software development

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.440
or database experience.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.340
And a lot of urban planners

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:48.480
or urban geographers

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.880
or urban sociologists

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:50.800
do not.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.780
They have great questions.

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:53.740
They have great theory.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.160
They want a hypothesis test,

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:55.480
right?

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.160
But we limit science

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.480
if our tools

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.640
are too difficult to use

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.160
or the right data

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.320
are too hard to access.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.100
Yeah.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.640
back to that

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.420
basic science

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.420
ideas, right?

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.240
Yeah.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.580
Yeah.

00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:10.660
So for something like this,

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:12.660
what OSMNX does

00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:13.480
is it puts

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.300
that kind of

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.120
overpass query

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:15.540
into much more

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.380
natural language.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:16.900
Since Python

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.920
is so readable

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.760
in the first place,

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:19.980
you can just say

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:20.660
something like

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.320
graph from place,

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.140
give it a city name,

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.060
say,

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:26.720
Pasadena, California.

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:28.580
My network type

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.240
will be drive.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.880
And then just like that,

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:33.280
I have that drivable

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.560
street network model

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.140
within the city limits

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.120
of Pasadena.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.380
Right.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:38.660
Yeah,

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:39.220
that sounds

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.200
entirely more usable.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.920
And one of the things

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:43.740
you said is that

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:46.300
it can be pretty expensive

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:46.940
to query

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:48.740
the overpass API.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:49.520
And so

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.780
your library

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:52.020
caches that stuff locally,

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:52.320
right?

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.380
That's right.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:53.580
Yeah.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.280
So expensive

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.480
in the computational sense,

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.340
all these things

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.640
are free to use.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.240
Yeah,

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.640
computationally expensive.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.420
Yeah,

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.120
exactly.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:02.700
And there's a lot

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:03.560
of time complexity

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.980
to it as well.

00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.940
So what we do

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:08.520
is we cache everything,

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:08.980
which helps you

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:09.840
avoid rate limiting.

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.280
Let's OSMNX

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.140
be a good neighbor

00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:14.100
to these free

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:16.540
public commons resources

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.300
that are out there.

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.100
Yeah,

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:19.520
interesting.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.860
It sounds almost like

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:21.340
you could have

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.720
Docker containers

00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.340
for different cities

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.440
that are preloaded

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.580
with all the data

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.100
that might be

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:27.880
interesting

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:29.260
and just instantaneously

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.980
answer a bunch

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:31.420
of questions.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.580
Yeah,

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.360
which is really

00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:33.880
my workload.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:34.820
So a lot of what I do

00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:35.300
will be

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:37.820
I study every

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.580
street network

00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:39.580
for every urbanized

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:40.620
area in the world,

00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:40.920
right?

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.680
So we'll have like

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:42.640
8,000 to 9,000

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.740
of these large

00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:45.040
urban models.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:46.560
and so I'll just

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.420
have things

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.660
cached locally

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.040
so that the model

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:51.940
building and analytics

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:53.060
are really at the

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.020
forefront rather than

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:54.600
the downloading

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:55.380
and querying

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.320
for a day.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:57.300
Right.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.120
It not only lets you

00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:58.780
be a good citizen

00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.060
and not hammer on

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:01.360
OpenStreetMaps API,

00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:03.400
but it just lets

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.280
your stuff work faster.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.800
So the incentives

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.720
are aligned there,

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:06.980
right?

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.060
Yeah,

00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:08.560
and in fact,

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.020
a lot of the time

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:09.860
when people first

00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.240
use OSMNX,

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.840
you'll download the,

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.080
say,

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.860
model of Los Angeles,

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:15.560
California,

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.200
and it takes a minute

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.000
to run the query

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:18.780
on their server,

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.480
download whatever

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.140
100 megabytes of data,

00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:24.220
and then build

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.900
that graph theoretic

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:26.260
model,

00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.160
do all the spatial

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.140
stuff to it.

00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:29.920
But after that,

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:31.200
it's nice and fast

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:31.640
the next time

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.000
that you do it

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.480
because you're able

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.120
to skip all

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.280
that preprocessing.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:34.600
Right.

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.760
It probably puts it

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.080
into some super

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.180
efficient data structure.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.940
Oct trees

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:42.900
or a tree

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:43.900
or some others,

00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:44.300
you know,

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:44.840
maybe dictionary

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.220
as you know,

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:45.500
it's right.

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:46.460
Yeah,

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:46.680
yeah,

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:47.360
and we use

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.560
spatial indexes

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.640
to accelerate

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.800
all of the spatial

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.020
queries locally

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:53.800
too as well.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.680
Is that built

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:56.900
into Geopandas?

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.500
Yeah,

00:35:58.500 --> 00:35:59.820
built into Geopandas,

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.680
there is an R tree,

00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.620
which is probably

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:03.640
the most common

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:04.600
spatial index,

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.320
but in addition

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:05.780
to that,

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:08.480
we also use

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.800
SciPy's

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.320
KD tree.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:12.020
they have a C

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:12.360
implementation

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:13.680
of a K-dimensional

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:14.180
tree

00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:15.360
that we use

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:15.880
for the nearest

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.600
neighbor search

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.160
so that if you,

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.380
so for example,

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.260
in a Google Maps

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:19.900
you say from my

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:20.460
origin to my

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:21.000
destination,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.580
we can do the

00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:22.300
same kind of thing,

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.520
say from this

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.400
point to that point,

00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.160
we'll snap the

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:25.760
nearest neighbor

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.520
on the network

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.360
and then solve

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.500
a path between them.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:29.600
okay,

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.540
so just the

00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.180
K-near's

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:32.000
neighbor algorithm

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:32.860
sort of applied

00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:33.120
to,

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:33.780
what is that,

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:34.580
the vectors

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.500
of the

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.600
intersections

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:39.260
or something

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.100
or then you,

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:40.800
the lines?

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:40.800
Yeah,

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.700
so normally

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.760
when you do

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.240
like origins

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:43.900
and destinations,

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:44.640
you would snap

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:45.380
to a node

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:45.900
in the network,

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:46.420
so the nodes

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:46.760
would be like

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.400
the intersections

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.060
and dead ends

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:49.920
and then the edges

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:51.560
would be the links,

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:52.340
the street segments

00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:52.980
that connect

00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:54.140
everything together

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.200
and when you

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.000
solve a path

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.700
on a graph,

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.060
it would be

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.480
from a start

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.520
node to an end

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.580
node and you'd

00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:04.220
minimize it by

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:04.700
something,

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:05.800
either the fewest

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.020
hops or the

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:07.860
shortest distance

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.860
or the shortest

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:09.820
travel time if you

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:10.320
incorporate,

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:10.560
say,

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.180
speed limits,

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:11.780
everything else,

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:12.760
you can bring in

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.200
congestion information

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.420
to minimize traffic

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.680
congested travel time

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.220
or minimize going

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:19.080
up and down hills

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:20.420
or anything else.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.660
Excellent.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.120
If I,

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.200
I got this data

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.260
downloaded and I

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:26.920
wanted to put it

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.160
into a proper

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.520
database and by

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:29.800
proper,

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.420
I mean one that

00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:31.940
like is its own

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:32.500
process,

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:33.620
different machines

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:34.220
can talk to it

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:34.760
in parallel and

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:34.980
whatever,

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:35.960
you know,

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:36.680
like Postgres

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:37.280
or Mongo

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:37.740
or something,

00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:39.140
are there good

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:40.440
databases that

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.320
you would recommend

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:41.760
or that you've

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.000
tried like EdgeDB

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:43.900
or Neo4j

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.400
or graph databases

00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.060
the right way to

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:47.020
go or what do

00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:47.320
you think?

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.680
It depends on

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.180
what you're trying

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.960
to do in terms

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.640
of OpenStreetMap

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.140
features,

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:52.620
so if you're just

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:53.400
downloading features

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:53.720
and you're not

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:54.420
worried about

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.020
you say those

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:55.820
topological

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:56.980
relationships between

00:37:56.980 --> 00:37:57.660
things like in a

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:58.280
street network,

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:02.260
any tabular data

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:03.580
structure will do,

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:03.900
you know,

00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:05.020
any kind of like

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:05.940
SQL database

00:38:05.940 --> 00:38:06.740
will do just fine.

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.500
For a graph model,

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:09.180
yeah,

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:09.740
you'd want some

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.400
kind of graph

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.200
database because

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.140
they can handle

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.200
graph algorithms

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:14.840
to do stuff like

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.520
routing or other

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:17.040
kinds of graph

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:17.780
analytics like

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:18.260
understanding

00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.520
connectivity on

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.040
the network.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.380
given this node,

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:23.000
tell me all the

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.380
things that are

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.080
connected to it.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:24.960
Those kind of

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.580
questions can be

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:25.780
answered.

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.000
Yeah,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:26.440
those kind of

00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:26.720
questions,

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:26.960
yeah.

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:27.380
Yeah,

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:28.660
they're kind of

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:29.300
pre-computed by

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:29.760
the indices

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.280
and the structures.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.820
What about

00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.360
bringing in other

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:34.720
data?

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:35.180
You know,

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.060
what if I have

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.640
real estate data

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:38.440
that doesn't come

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.800
from OpenStreetMap,

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.220
but I want to

00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.620
pull that in and

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:43.460
overlay it with,

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:43.740
say,

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:44.800
zoning information

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.180
overlapped with

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.040
census data that

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:48.760
gives me how

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.500
much that person

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.800
in that area

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.900
makes per year

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:54.520
on average or

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.000
something like

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.240
that?

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:55.800
Can you answer

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.300
questions like

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:56.480
that?

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.200
Yeah,

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:57.840
really common

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.280
use case.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.920
So OSMNX can

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.480
kind of do that

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:00.900
by itself,

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:01.760
but mostly as a

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:02.420
tool in the

00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:03.420
toolkit to do

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:03.660
it.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:05.580
So,

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.220
you know,

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:06.680
a common way

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.100
that we often

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:07.520
will do this

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:07.840
is for

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.440
accessibility

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.180
analyses.

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.020
So,

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:10.520
for example,

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.540
here at my

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:11.920
house,

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.180
how many

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.540
grocery stores

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:15.020
could I

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:15.740
access within

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:16.720
a 15-minute

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.280
walk?

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:17.780
And it gives

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:18.260
you a sense

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.860
of, you know,

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:20.660
how car

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:21.200
dependent or

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:21.820
not a place

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:22.100
is.

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:23.080
And also,

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:23.440
we can start

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.020
looking at food

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:24.660
deserts in

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:25.360
certain communities

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:25.700
where people

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:26.140
don't have

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:26.580
access to

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:27.140
fresh food.

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:28.060
So for that,

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:28.320
what you're

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:28.780
doing is you

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.520
have a model

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.120
of the network

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:30.900
and then you

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:31.660
also have all

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.120
of this point

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:32.720
of interest

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:33.360
data, right?

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:33.860
So where all

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:34.340
these amenities

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:35.000
are located.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.160
You would

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:36.940
then snap

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:37.900
them, load

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:38.740
them onto

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.480
the graph,

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.540
and then you

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.040
can calculate

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:41.680
accessibility

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:42.920
by looking

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.180
at where

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:43.680
those things

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:44.280
are located

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.000
and you

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:45.240
can either

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:45.540
look at

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:45.940
cumulative

00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:46.840
opportunities

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:47.900
within some

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:48.680
time horizon

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:49.720
or distance

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:50.540
to the nearest

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:51.340
opportunity.

00:39:51.340 --> 00:39:52.360
You can put

00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:53.160
different decays

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:53.860
on it, like

00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.700
the utility

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:55.200
of it being

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:55.860
so far away

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:56.360
drops off

00:39:56.360 --> 00:39:56.840
with a linear

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.400
decay the

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:57.900
further I have

00:39:57.900 --> 00:39:58.260
to go,

00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.320
or a non-linear

00:39:59.320 --> 00:39:59.920
decay if it

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.380
really drops

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.060
off fast.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:01.440
Right.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.760
If a grocery store

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:04.480
is three miles

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.260
away, it's not

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.240
one-third as

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:06.940
useful as one

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:07.280
that's one

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:07.720
mile away.

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.020
It's quite

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:09.780
more to carry

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:10.180
your groceries

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:10.660
that far.

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:12.020
And similarly,

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:12.720
there's marginal

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:13.760
utility for the

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.960
30th grocery store

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.660
that you can reach.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:16.240
It doesn't give you

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:16.960
that much benefit

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.900
over the 29th

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:18.720
that you can reach.

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.920
Whereas the first

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.660
and second are

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:21.400
very valuable.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.640
Yeah, if it goes

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.500
from zero to one

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.060
and one to two,

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.260
those are big jumps

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:25.700
right there.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:26.360
Yep.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:27.500
Yeah.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.200
Okay.

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.200
Very interesting.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.180
How about some

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.640
projects that

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:33.540
people might be

00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.440
thinking about?

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:35.960
You know,

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:37.200
they look at this

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:37.600
data and they're

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:37.900
like, wow,

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:38.820
this looks really

00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.540
detailed and neat

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:40.920
and we have all

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:41.340
these different

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.380
aspects we can

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:43.140
ask about,

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.660
but maybe they

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:45.160
just want to

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:45.800
play around.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.440
Yeah.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.880
I mean,

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.480
hopefully,

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.160
if you look at

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:50.800
the getting started

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.620
guide or these

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:52.220
usage examples,

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:52.640
you'll see it's

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.300
really easy to

00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:53.860
play around.

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:54.120
You know,

00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:54.900
two, three lines

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.580
of code and you

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:56.760
have a visualization

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.360
of your local

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.140
street network.

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.200
A few things

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.200
that we've done

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.180
in my lab

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.020
at USC

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.220
that may spark

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:04.860
some interest.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.500
We look at

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.120
air pollution

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.160
exposure and

00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:08.960
driving patterns

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.640
in Los Angeles

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.200
to try to

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:10.800
understand,

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.240
you know,

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.000
who's driving

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.600
and where

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.180
and then in

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:14.520
turn,

00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.580
who is exposed

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.200
to that tailpipe,

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:17.960
those tailpipe

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:18.660
emissions from

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:19.340
those cars.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.400
So we use

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:21.420
OSMNX to

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:21.980
model those

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:22.700
street networks

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:23.980
to simulate

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.220
those trips

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:26.000
and to look

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:26.360
at what

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.220
census tracts

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:27.860
that stuff

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:28.380
goes through.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.640
We also use

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:30.200
it for studies

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.260
of urban form.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.500
So that is

00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:33.720
kind of the

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:34.320
shape,

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:34.960
texture,

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:35.780
density,

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:36.520
the grain

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.200
of a city.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.260
I have this

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:40.180
series of

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.260
square mile

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.240
visualizations

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:42.920
of different

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.580
cities around

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.080
the world.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.280
And you can

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:45.920
really quickly

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:46.500
see how

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.820
different forms

00:41:47.820 --> 00:41:48.880
of urbanism

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.000
look relative

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.220
to each other.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:53.120
So a place

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.140
like Irvine,

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:54.880
California,

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:55.220
here in

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:55.400
Southern

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.080
California,

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.060
has this

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:57.920
really coarse

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:58.580
grained

00:41:58.580 --> 00:41:59.600
street network.

00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.940
A place

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:01.920
like Venice

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.140
in Italy

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.360
has incredibly

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.240
fine grained

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.080
like spiderweb

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.980
street network.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:08.420
Stuff like that

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:08.860
really helps

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:09.220
to kind of

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:09.980
convey these

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.140
different modes

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.320
of urbanism

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.440
and urbanization.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:14.780
We also use

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:15.220
these to look

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.300
at disaster

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.020
resilience.

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:18.580
That is,

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:19.380
different street

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:19.940
networks

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.560
will be better

00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:22.180
if things

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:22.640
start going

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.420
wrong around

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:23.780
them.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:24.640
Things with

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.460
more redundancy,

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.260
more connectivity

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:26.840
built in

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.480
are easier

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.100
to route

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:29.380
around if

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.000
parts start

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:30.500
failing in

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.020
a fire,

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:31.560
in an

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:31.920
earthquake.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.840
So we can

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:33.320
calculate some

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:33.480
of these

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.140
characteristics

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:35.360
and then make

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:35.980
recommendations

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:36.560
to planners

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.240
and policymakers

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.480
about how

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:38.760
to make

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.060
your street

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:39.460
network,

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:39.940
how to

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:40.540
intervene in

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:40.880
it to make

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.160
it more

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:41.520
resilient.

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:43.160
Yeah,

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.540
in my area

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.700
there's an

00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.280
east-west

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:46.720
highway,

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:47.580
one of the

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:48.940
very few

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:49.920
that goes

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:50.780
from the

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:51.620
city west.

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:51.960
It has to

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:52.220
go through

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:52.760
this mountain

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.480
tunnel and

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:54.900
it's two

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:55.380
lanes each

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:55.800
way in the

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:55.940
mountain,

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:56.240
or three

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:56.680
lanes in the

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.100
mountain tunnel

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:57.580
and there's

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.960
even on a

00:42:58.960 --> 00:42:59.520
Saturday

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.100
afternoon

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:00.440
there's

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.200
stopped cars

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.080
trying to go

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:03.400
through that

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:04.260
tunnel and

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:04.700
those are on

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:05.100
good days.

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:05.620
Imagine if

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:06.160
there was an

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:06.580
emergency,

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.060
it would just

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:07.560
be done.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:08.440
Yeah,

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.300
that's the

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:09.780
26,

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:10.340
right?

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:11.500
Exactly,

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:12.080
it is the

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:12.440
26.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:13.080
Yeah,

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:13.640
I used to

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:13.960
live in

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:14.320
Portland.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.000
I lived in

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:17.660
Goose Hollow

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.020
and my chair

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:19.400
was in

00:43:19.400 --> 00:43:19.960
Beaverton,

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:20.560
so I would

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:20.980
have to go

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:21.300
to that

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:21.960
tunnel to

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:22.340
go work

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:22.520
out.

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.080
It would

00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:23.480
always be

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:23.800
like,

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.060
you know,

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:25.480
one of

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.180
these days.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.860
Exactly,

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:29.420
yeah,

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:29.940
I live about

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.040
a mile from

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:31.540
Goose Hollow

00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:32.020
up through

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:32.480
that tunnel.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:33.080
So,

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:33.320
yeah.

00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.640
Very cool.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:35.900
Yeah,

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:36.300
but there's

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:36.520
just,

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.420
and that one's

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:37.960
hard to fix

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:38.960
because there's

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:39.540
houses all

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.100
along there.

00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.240
It's a big

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:41.540
hill.

00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:42.300
It's hard

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:42.460
to go

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:42.860
over it.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.040
You know,

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:44.260
it would

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.280
take a lot

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:45.740
of willpower

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:46.060
to make

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:46.620
another tunnel.

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:47.840
Yeah,

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:48.660
interesting thing.

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:49.380
I did my

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.040
PhD at

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:50.520
Berkeley,

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:51.200
and there

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:51.620
is another

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:52.200
tunnel there

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:52.760
that goes

00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.300
from that

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:53.560
kind of

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.480
inner East

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:54.840
Bay,

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:55.300
Berkeley,

00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:55.780
Oakland

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.180
border,

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.420
out to the

00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:58.240
further east

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.020
suburbs like

00:43:59.020 --> 00:43:59.400
Orinda,

00:43:59.400 --> 00:43:59.920
Moraga,

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:00.600
and so forth.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.520
And that

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:02.120
tunnel is

00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.500
really old.

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:03.780
I mean,

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:04.100
it's,

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:04.600
I don't know,

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.500
80 years old,

00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:05.920
maybe something

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.480
like that.

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:07.000
and it

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:07.440
determined

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.200
that when

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:08.540
the big

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:08.880
one does

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.380
eventually

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:09.800
hit,

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:10.360
it will

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:10.760
fail,

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:11.120
it will

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:11.660
collapse.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:12.740
And it's

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:13.280
not,

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.640
it's cost

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:15.300
prohibitive to

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:15.760
actually prevent

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:16.060
that from

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:16.460
happening.

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.380
So the

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.260
idea is it

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.060
will collapse

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.140
and crush

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:20.520
everyone in

00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:20.920
that tunnel,

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:21.380
and they

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:21.900
will then build

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:22.460
a new tunnel

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:23.360
at that point

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:23.820
when they have

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:23.820
to.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:24.120
Oh my

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:24.560
goodness.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:25.920
We have

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.440
to look

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:26.920
forward to.

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:28.880
Yeah,

00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:29.680
just go

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:30.200
quickly when

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:30.380
you're in

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:30.700
the tunnel.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:31.360
Get out

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:31.560
of there.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.260
I always

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:32.540
did.

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:35.620
Amazing.

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.920
All right.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.120
Let's talk

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:39.500
real quickly

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:40.280
about integrating

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.540
OpenOSMNX

00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:44.960
with other

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.300
data science

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:46.900
tooling,

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:47.260
right?

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:47.780
We have so

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:48.240
many different

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:48.580
things.

00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:48.960
We have

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.260
PyTorch,

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:50.800
we have

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.320
Pandas,

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:51.820
we have

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:52.620
Polars,

00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:54.300
all the

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:54.660
different

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.260
things.

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:55.500
Like,

00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.020
what are the

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:56.460
different

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:56.940
integration

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:57.700
features?

00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:58.020
You know,

00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:58.340
you talked

00:44:58.340 --> 00:44:58.520
about

00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:58.740
data

00:44:58.740 --> 00:44:59.080
frames,

00:44:59.080 --> 00:44:59.460
that sounds

00:44:59.460 --> 00:44:59.660
like

00:44:59.660 --> 00:45:00.320
Pandas and

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:01.900
Geopandas,

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:02.100
right?

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.060
So that's

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:03.640
one sort

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.100
of path

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:04.860
across those

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:05.200
things.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.920
Yeah,

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.820
so OSMNX

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:12.580
is built

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:13.580
primarily on

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:14.220
top of

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:15.520
three things.

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:15.900
It's

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:16.680
NetworkX

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.300
for the

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:17.900
graph

00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:18.420
models,

00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:20.560
Geopandas

00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.040
for the

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:21.500
spatial

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:21.980
data

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:22.420
frames,

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:23.420
and

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:24.200
Matplotlib

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:24.920
for the

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.100
visualizations.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.660
in the

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:29.520
spatial

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.280
Python

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:30.740
world,

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:31.020
most

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:31.320
stuff

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:31.800
happens

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:31.940
in

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:32.120
the

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:32.660
Pandas

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:33.660
ecosystem

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.900
because

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:35.940
Geopandas

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:36.180
and

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:37.060
PySAL

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:37.200
and

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:37.520
similar

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:37.900
tools

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:38.160
are

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.120
very

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:39.660
Pandas

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:40.240
oriented.

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.380
I know

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:41.600
there's been

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:42.000
some work

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:42.300
toward

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.600
Geopolar,

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.760
but it's

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:44.980
kind of

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:45.300
in its

00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.060
infancy,

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:46.620
as far

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:46.900
as I

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:47.140
know,

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:47.760
to this

00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:48.060
extent.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:48.380
But

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.300
that'll

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:49.780
be great

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.240
when

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:50.780
that's

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:51.240
available.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.180
NetworkX

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:52.460
is another

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:52.900
funny one

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:53.340
because it's

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:54.080
a pure

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:54.820
Python

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.340
implementation

00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:56.840
has a lot

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.160
of loops,

00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:57.420
and so it

00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:57.620
can go

00:45:57.620 --> 00:45:58.140
really slow

00:45:58.140 --> 00:45:58.980
over calculating

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:00.120
some of

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:00.700
these big

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:01.880
time complexity

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.340
graph algorithms,

00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:04.740
things like

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:05.400
betweenness

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.000
centrality,

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:06.700
where you have

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.620
this massive

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:08.280
OD

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:08.900
major,

00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:09.500
basically,

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:10.500
all the nodes

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:10.980
to all the

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:11.340
nodes.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:11.700
Yeah,

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:11.900
yeah,

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:12.100
some

00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:12.960
combinatorial

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:13.640
craziness.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.540
It ends

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:15.000
up being

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:15.960
very time

00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:16.300
consuming

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:17.060
to calculate

00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:17.840
those kinds

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.480
of things

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.280
for a

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:19.840
metro

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:20.220
area

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:20.800
sized

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:21.460
network

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:21.900
model.

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:22.840
So

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:23.860
we'll

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:24.140
integrate

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:24.340
with

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:24.560
other

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.120
tools.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.340
iGraph

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.220
does that

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:28.300
in C.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.580
Also,

00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.720
using tools

00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:31.780
like QGraph

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:32.000
where you

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:32.260
can do it

00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:32.480
on the

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:32.960
GPU

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.040
instead.

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:34.400
Oh,

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:34.620
wow,

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:34.980
okay,

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:35.620
yeah.

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.220
But it's

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.260
limited because

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.440
the waiting

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:40.240
scheme doesn't

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.060
let you say,

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:41.560
I want to

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:41.960
minimize

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.180
travel time,

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:43.720
stuff like

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:44.040
that.

00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:44.640
I see.

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.320
Yeah,

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:47.920
and then

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.020
also

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:49.460
integrated

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:49.960
with

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.040
Folium

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:51.840
to create

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.600
interactive

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.320
leaflet

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.320
web maps

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.180
out of

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:55.740
the box.

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.000
Yeah,

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:57.980
I wonder

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.200
how that

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:00.600
the free

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:00.820
threaded

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:01.160
Python

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.280
stuff will

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:03.480
affect some

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:03.660
of those

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:04.140
computational

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:04.480
things.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.100
Like that

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:05.520
everything

00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:06.100
compared

00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:06.300
with

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:06.640
everything

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:06.940
else

00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:07.260
sounds

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:08.480
like

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:08.820
a

00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:09.140
so-called

00:47:09.140 --> 00:47:09.820
embarrassingly

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:10.340
parallel

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:11.060
sort of

00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:11.460
problem,

00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:12.500
right?

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:13.380
And so

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:14.360
if you

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:14.660
could just

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:14.760
say,

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.020
well,

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:15.300
you have

00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:15.900
10 cores,

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:16.500
so let's

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:16.780
just do

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:17.720
10 blocks

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:17.960
of them

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:18.260
all in

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:18.580
parallel.

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:19.900
Yeah,

00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:20.520
so that's

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:20.820
what we

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:21.640
do when

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:21.860
we do

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:22.240
it in

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:22.420
pure

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:22.880
Python.

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:23.740
So we'll

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.940
use

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:26.180
multiprocessing

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:26.500
generally

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:27.260
on your

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:27.840
CPUs.

00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:28.160
The only

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:28.740
challenge

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.100
is that

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:32.240
your OD

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:32.860
matrix,

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:33.260
your origin

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:33.660
destination

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:34.220
matrix is

00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:34.820
growing at

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:35.400
this exponential

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.000
rate,

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:36.920
but then

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.240
there's a

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:37.820
linear number

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:38.340
of cores,

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:38.800
so going

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.180
from 1

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:39.660
to 24

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.200
and dividing

00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:40.660
by a factor

00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.280
of 24.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:42.400
when you

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:42.640
have

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.020
a million

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:44.860
nodes

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:45.320
times a

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:45.620
million

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:46.480
nodes

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:46.980
in your

00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:47.460
graph,

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:48.840
it's going

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:49.100
to take

00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:49.300
you a

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:49.880
long time.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:50.260
It's still

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:50.600
going to be

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:50.860
slow.

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.020
You've gone

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:52.540
from months

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.260
down to

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:53.720
weeks.

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.220
Yeah,

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:55.440
I mean,

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:55.780
you're still

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:56.260
dividing it

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:56.540
by the

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:56.900
number of

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:57.160
cores,

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.440
but it

00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.300
doesn't

00:47:59.300 --> 00:47:59.560
necessarily

00:47:59.560 --> 00:47:59.960
mean it's

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:00.400
super fast.

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.100
Although the

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:01.700
GPU stuff

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:02.160
seems like

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:02.420
it could

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:02.900
absolutely

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.140
fly,

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:04.420
right?

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:05.440
Yeah,

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:06.020
that makes

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:06.820
a big

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:07.380
difference,

00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:07.920
and I think

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:08.400
that's really

00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:09.180
the area

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:09.880
of growth

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.220
where handling,

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:11.680
I mean,

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.280
basically getting

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:12.840
out of Python

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:13.500
loops in the

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:14.160
first place

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:15.060
is the biggest

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:15.740
area of

00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:16.120
growth,

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.200
and then doing

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:17.840
things on a,

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:18.460
since these are

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:19.200
really just very

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:19.780
simple linear

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:20.880
algebra problems,

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.180
being able to

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:23.080
do them on a

00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:23.840
GPU makes it

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:24.200
much more

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:24.580
efficient.

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:25.660
Yeah,

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:26.600
did you hear

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.400
about this

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:27.960
thing,

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.040
this new

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:29.440
NVIDIA,

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:29.960
I don't know

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:30.120
what it's

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:30.420
called,

00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:31.640
Project Digits,

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:32.200
where they

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:32.720
announced a

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:33.940
3000 desktop

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:35.900
dollar desktop

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:37.000
AI computer,

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:37.180
I mean,

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:37.680
they call it

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:37.920
AI,

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:38.340
but really

00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:38.600
it's just

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.280
a GPU.

00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:40.820
It is

00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:41.140
interesting,

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:41.360
no,

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:41.580
I hadn't

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:41.880
heard about

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:42.120
that.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:42.740
And this

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:43.100
thing,

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:44.140
it's the

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:44.640
size of a

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.140
Mac mini,

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:45.720
it's this,

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.340
if you look

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:46.680
at the

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:46.920
picture,

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.200
it's a

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:47.540
little bit

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:47.840
of a

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:48.200
golden

00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.360
thing,

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:49.880
it's kind

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:50.300
of clever

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:50.560
that made

00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:50.800
it gold,

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:51.040
but,

00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:51.720
you know,

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.380
that's a,

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:54.180
that's a

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:54.920
massive

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:55.880
computer

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:56.640
sitting next

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:57.040
to you,

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.660
that you

00:48:58.660 --> 00:48:59.360
could run

00:48:59.360 --> 00:48:59.540
that,

00:48:59.540 --> 00:48:59.960
this is

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:00.160
pretty

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:00.560
interesting,

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:00.920
actually,

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:01.340
I think.

00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:03.080
Yeah,

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.520
that is,

00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:05.860
that is,

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:06.240
I mean,

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:06.800
it's shocking

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.020
too,

00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:07.340
because it

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:07.720
looks so

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:08.140
much smaller

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:08.680
than like

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.420
just a

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:10.700
NVIDIA card

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:11.220
in your

00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:12.120
desktop.

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:13.240
I think it

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:13.960
basically is

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:14.740
just the

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:15.200
GPU,

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.200
and nothing to

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:17.400
do with

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:17.740
graphics,

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:18.240
and then you

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:18.860
just remote

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:19.820
into it over,

00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:20.380
I don't know,

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:20.880
a terminal,

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.360
or however you,

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.200
or maybe you

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:23.840
set it as the

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:24.500
Docker host,

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:25.120
and then you

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:25.720
just do Docker

00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:26.140
locally,

00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:26.760
but it runs

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.020
there,

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:27.260
you know,

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:27.700
that type of

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:27.880
thing.

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:28.820
I don't

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:29.020
know how

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:29.300
it works,

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.000
but I kind

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:30.240
of want

00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:30.460
one.

00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:31.400
Yeah,

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:32.620
I mean,

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:32.880
it looks

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:33.440
sexy enough,

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:33.820
but of course

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:34.040
you would

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:34.440
want one,

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:34.620
right?

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:35.600
Of course,

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:35.980
but if you

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:36.440
had questions

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:36.820
like that,

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:37.520
if you say

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:37.800
I have a

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:38.360
million nodes

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:38.620
and I

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:38.980
could run

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:39.260
that on

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:39.700
a GPU,

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:40.620
getting

00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:41.160
something like

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.380
this that's,

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:42.960
you know,

00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:43.460
kind of the

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.680
H100 style

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.180
of like the

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:45.900
really large

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:46.420
just meant

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:47.060
for compute,

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:47.620
not really

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:48.020
a graphics

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:48.340
card,

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:49.800
seems like

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:50.060
that would

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:50.800
really unlock

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:51.300
some interesting

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:51.920
options.

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:52.880
Yeah,

00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:53.420
totally.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:53.900
I mean,

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:54.120
yeah,

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.260
so I have

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:56.780
a GeForce

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:57.620
card in my

00:49:57.620 --> 00:49:58.560
desktop that

00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:59.160
I'll pass

00:49:59.160 --> 00:49:59.420
some of that

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:00.000
stuff locally

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:00.360
onto,

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.840
but another

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.480
one of the

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.280
academic benefits

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:03.980
at USC,

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:04.580
we have a

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:05.420
high performance

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:07.080
computing buster

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.000
that I can

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.080
schedule tasks

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:10.920
to run on

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.140
that,

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:11.660
say over winter

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:12.040
break,

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:13.080
and then come

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:13.800
back in January

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.520
and the month

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.720
of 1,000

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.340
CPUs is all

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:19.660
done.

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:21.420
That's amazing.

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.520
we had a

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.280
mainframe,

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.660
a silicon

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.600
graphics mainframe

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.200
when I was

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:28.040
studying math

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:28.500
that we could

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.560
all work on

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:30.520
in this group

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.100
of maybe 10

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:31.460
of us,

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:34.380
and it

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:35.380
wasn't as big

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:35.680
as what you're

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:35.840
saying,

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:36.340
but it was,

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:36.660
you know,

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:37.640
a quite expensive

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:38.640
big machine.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:39.880
It had its own

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:40.380
room and it was

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:40.920
really loud to

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:41.340
go into that

00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:41.560
room,

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:43.700
and I remember

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:44.360
we came in

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:44.700
to,

00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:45.580
I came in

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:46.340
to do

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:46.740
whatever I was

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:47.300
working on

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:48.340
as a grad

00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:48.840
student or

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:49.180
whatever,

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:49.760
I think I was

00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:50.120
a senior,

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:50.660
anyway,

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.120
came in

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:51.960
to work

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:52.180
on my

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:52.620
project,

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:53.720
and nobody

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:54.280
could access

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:54.560
it,

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.100
and it was

00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:55.560
still in there

00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.040
making loud

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:56.700
noises like it

00:50:56.700 --> 00:50:57.060
was running,

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:58.020
but it acted

00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:58.580
like it wasn't

00:50:58.580 --> 00:50:58.820
running,

00:50:58.820 --> 00:50:59.520
and so what is

00:50:59.520 --> 00:50:59.900
going on?

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:00.600
One of the

00:51:00.600 --> 00:51:01.080
other grad

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:01.500
students had

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:02.040
run a job

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:02.420
like you're

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.000
talking about,

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.040
but they were

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:04.700
having trouble

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:05.140
getting into

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.040
work because

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:06.840
they were math

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:07.060
people,

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:07.600
not programmers,

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.200
and they

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.660
started logging

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.180
everything,

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:12.140
and there were

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.260
no limits on

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:13.880
what people could

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:14.380
do to the

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:14.760
computer,

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.720
the people

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:16.180
had set it

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:16.380
up,

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:17.420
and so

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.040
what had

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:18.440
happened is

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:18.920
it ran

00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.320
100% CPU

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:20.820
on all the

00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:21.540
cores all night

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:22.300
logging until it

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:23.000
ran out of space,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:23.620
and then apparently

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:24.360
the computer won't

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.020
run anymore if it

00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:25.720
has zero more

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:26.040
bytes,

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:26.600
it needed some

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:27.260
temp file or

00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:27.540
something,

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:28.580
and so it

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:29.960
was just done.

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:31.140
I imagine you

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:31.800
guys have more

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.440
guardrails than

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:33.680
that.

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:34.840
Yeah,

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:35.820
a lot of

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:36.180
guardrails.

00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:36.640
I would love

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.140
to try to do

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:38.440
something like

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:38.860
that just for

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:39.220
the yuck

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:39.680
sometime,

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.200
but we

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:41.520
got to go

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:41.780
whatever.

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:43.800
The admins of

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.240
that computer

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:44.740
would not

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:45.340
please with

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:45.760
that grad

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.000
student.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:46.940
I can only

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:47.300
imagine.

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.340
It took a

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:49.060
long time to

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:49.480
get it going,

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:50.380
like a day of

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:50.900
work to get

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:51.480
it turned

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.040
back on,

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:52.520
because they

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:52.860
didn't even

00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:53.100
know what

00:51:53.100 --> 00:51:53.400
was wrong

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:53.720
with it at

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:53.940
first,

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:54.200
it just

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:54.420
wouldn't

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:54.860
turn on.

00:51:54.860 --> 00:51:55.960
Oh,

00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:56.200
well.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.760
Jumping back

00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:58.420
a moment

00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:00.760
to the,

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:01.120
no,

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:01.480
that's not

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:01.740
the one I

00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:01.960
wanted to

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:02.140
copy,

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.020
to the

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.480
integration,

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.120
have you

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:05.520
considered

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:05.980
working with

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:06.680
narwhals?

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.280
I looked

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.380
into narwhals

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:10.780
recently.

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:12.020
my understanding

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:12.300
is one of

00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:12.480
the things

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:12.740
it does

00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:13.260
well is it

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:13.540
kind of

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:14.180
abstracts away

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:14.800
from pandas

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:15.780
versus pollers,

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:16.700
so you're

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.520
less tool

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:17.820
dependent,

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:18.100
right?

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.000
Yeah,

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:19.200
and it

00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:19.720
also lets

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:20.620
people who

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:20.940
want to

00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:21.600
consume your

00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:22.080
library,

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:23.260
who want

00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:23.780
to do

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:24.280
their work

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:24.900
in pollers,

00:52:24.900 --> 00:52:25.840
talk pollers

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:26.180
to your

00:52:26.180 --> 00:52:26.660
project,

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:27.040
and people

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:27.280
want to

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:27.920
do pandas,

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.780
talk pandas,

00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:29.720
as well as

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.060
QDF,

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:31.620
Moden,

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:32.860
Pyro,

00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:33.200
and other,

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:33.800
it kind of

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:34.620
is an

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:35.120
adapting

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:35.580
layer,

00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:36.000
so people

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:36.380
can work

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:36.780
in their

00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:37.160
native

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:37.580
framework

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:37.980
and then

00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:38.400
talk to

00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:38.600
you.

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:39.660
Yeah.

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:40.660
I mean,

00:52:40.660 --> 00:52:41.260
yeah,

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:41.780
on paper

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:42.220
it sounds

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:42.640
great.

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:43.060
I haven't

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:43.560
played with

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:43.800
it yet,

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:44.080
other than

00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:44.380
just being

00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:45.060
familiar with

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:45.200
it,

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.240
but I mean,

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:46.860
that sounds

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:47.820
like the

00:52:47.820 --> 00:52:48.320
ideal,

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:48.620
right?

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:49.100
We shouldn't

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:49.880
be enforcing

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:50.340
these certain

00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:51.160
APIs or

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:51.960
languages on

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:52.280
people.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.100
Yeah,

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:54.060
it does look

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:54.360
interesting.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:55.340
I believe

00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:56.340
it's foundational

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.340
internals or

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.340
maybe just

00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:58.900
the API,

00:52:58.900 --> 00:52:59.400
but they're

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.380
pollers,

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:01.100
not pandas,

00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:01.500
so maybe

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:01.940
that's not

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:02.220
as good

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:02.580
of a fit,

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:03.500
but it could

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:03.760
be an

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.120
interesting

00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:04.960
thing to look

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:05.500
in the future

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:06.180
to sort

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:07.200
of make it

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:07.920
native to all

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:08.340
the different

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:09.160
data frame libraries

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:09.560
that people

00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.040
want to talk

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:10.220
in.

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:11.180
Yeah,

00:53:11.180 --> 00:53:11.800
yeah,

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:12.320
definitely.

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.180
Are you going

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:13.620
to need a new

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:13.880
grant?

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.060
Yeah,

00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.520
here's the basic

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:17.180
science stuff,

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:17.340
right?

00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:17.540
I mean,

00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:18.240
if I can't get

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:18.700
them interested

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:20.060
in network models,

00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:20.540
I don't know

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:21.000
about getting

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:21.600
into the nuts

00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:22.060
and bolts

00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.100
of which

00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:24.400
data frame

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:25.760
API we're

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.000
going to have

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:26.620
people use.

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:28.460
yeah,

00:53:28.460 --> 00:53:28.520
yeah,

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.140
yeah,

00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:29.700
absolutely.

00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:31.060
All right,

00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:31.360
well,

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:32.340
let's close

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:33.020
this whole

00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:33.580
conversation

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:34.980
out by

00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:35.640
talking about

00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.360
something that

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:37.040
I know is

00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:37.780
on a lot

00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:38.180
of people's

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:38.500
minds,

00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:39.820
and that's

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:40.460
LLMs.

00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:41.420
And,

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:41.880
you know,

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:44.940
what do LLMs

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:45.700
mean for this

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.220
mapping data

00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:46.580
and the types

00:53:46.580 --> 00:53:46.980
of questions

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:47.680
you can answer

00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.960
and OSMNX,

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:50.920
all these types

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:51.200
of things?

00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:51.360
Like,

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:51.800
how's that

00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:53.160
shaping your

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:53.500
world?

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:55.040
Yeah,

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:55.500
so,

00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.140
two ways

00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:57.440
that I like

00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.040
to think about it.

00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.320
One is what

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:00.540
LLMs have to

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:01.520
offer us today,

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:02.780
and then one

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:03.700
is what LLMs

00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:04.520
have to offer us,

00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:04.680
say,

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.500
five to ten years

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:05.940
from now.

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:06.280
That is,

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:06.900
how do we

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:07.580
future-proof

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:08.260
ourselves,

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:09.360
our careers,

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:11.280
our livelihoods,

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:11.540
and,

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:12.340
I mean,

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:13.320
or just optimistically,

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:13.760
how do we

00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:14.880
really get ahead

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:15.380
of it to take

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:16.400
advantage of

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.200
nice things

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:17.500
that they'll

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:18.260
have to offer?

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:19.920
Today,

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.220
I am

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:22.560
deeply unimpressed

00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:23.100
with most of

00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:23.800
the use cases

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:24.620
that I see

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:25.280
for it.

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:26.220
I think that

00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:26.840
the outputs

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:27.680
only look good

00:54:27.680 --> 00:54:27.980
to people

00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:28.580
who aren't

00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:29.360
experts and

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:29.960
don't know

00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:30.600
how wrong

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:31.140
it is.

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:31.820
It does

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:32.200
some things

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:32.460
well,

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:32.740
you know,

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:33.320
like having

00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:34.220
a copilot

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:34.620
while you're

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:35.120
coding and

00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:35.440
having it

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:35.940
recommending,

00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:37.520
that's nice.

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:37.720
I mean,

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:38.080
it's like

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:38.860
tab complete

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:39.460
from years

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:39.680
ago.

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:39.980
It's the

00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:40.580
same kind

00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:40.920
of thing,

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:41.780
just iterating

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:42.040
it.

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.180
But,

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:43.660
you know,

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:44.580
when someone

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:45.660
tells it,

00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:46.260
you know,

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:46.940
here's the

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:47.180
prompt,

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:47.680
generate my

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.500
algorithm for

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:48.800
me,

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.200
two things.

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.140
One,

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:52.160
it very often

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:52.700
doesn't do that

00:54:52.700 --> 00:54:53.240
good of a job

00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:53.740
even at this

00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:54.020
point,

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:54.460
and number

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:54.940
two,

00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:55.980
if you don't

00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:56.760
enjoy doing

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:57.220
that kind

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:57.660
of thing,

00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:58.060
I'm not

00:54:58.060 --> 00:54:58.580
sure why

00:54:58.580 --> 00:54:59.680
you're in

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.220
software

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:00.740
development

00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:01.500
in the first

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:01.960
place.

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:03.520
For me,

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:04.020
when I

00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:04.620
interface with

00:55:04.620 --> 00:55:04.800
it,

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:05.720
it's usually

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.060
in the

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:06.640
classroom.

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:07.780
And you'll

00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:08.100
have,

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:08.440
so,

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:09.320
you know,

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:09.700
people like to

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:10.220
complain to kids

00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:10.680
these days.

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:11.260
It's the same

00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:11.740
way it was

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:12.080
when I was

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:12.520
in school.

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.280
You know,

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:13.820
a third of

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:14.380
the class

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:15.020
loves a

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:15.360
subject.

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:16.200
They're just

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:16.780
killing it.

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:17.260
They want to

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:17.600
be there.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:18.040
They want a

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:18.660
job in this.

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:19.560
A third of

00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:20.080
the class,

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:20.580
they're like,

00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:20.720
well,

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:21.180
it's a required

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:21.640
class.

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:22.220
I'll try to

00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:22.540
do what I

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:22.860
can.

00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:23.740
And a third

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:24.260
of them say,

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:25.180
I don't know

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:25.820
why I'm here.

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:26.380
Why is this a

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:27.080
required course?

00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.000
I hate this.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:28.920
Is there any

00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:29.640
way I can cheat

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:30.180
to just get a

00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:30.740
passing grade?

00:55:30.740 --> 00:55:31.580
Where's my

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:31.940
shortcut?

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.180
Exactly.

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:34.200
I mean,

00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:34.620
and,

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:35.040
you know,

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:35.920
the difference

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:36.620
today is that

00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:37.700
LLMs make it

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:38.780
so much easier

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:39.200
and they really

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.560
normalized cheating

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:41.640
as well.

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:42.940
Where we don't

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:43.860
have that good

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.060
of systems in

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:45.720
place to be

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:46.840
able to detect

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:47.740
it for code,

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:48.700
for writing,

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.360
for anything.

00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.060
And I think

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:51.500
one of the

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:52.160
problems here,

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:52.680
you know,

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:53.300
it goes back

00:55:53.300 --> 00:55:54.600
to like licensing

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.060
or attribution.

00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:57.620
When we

00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:58.460
normalize this

00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.080
kind of cheating,

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.180
we're normalizing

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:01.220
taking credit

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:01.740
for things

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.260
that aren't

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:02.980
our work.

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:03.300
and if we're

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:03.640
doing that

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:04.160
in school,

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.120
we build

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:05.720
those habits.

00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:06.140
What's it

00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:06.480
going to look

00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:06.900
like when

00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:07.740
we're working

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:08.220
in the workforce?

00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:08.640
We either

00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:09.200
don't have

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:09.640
the skills

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:10.120
that people

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:10.560
think we

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:11.800
have or

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:12.400
we think

00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:12.940
it's just

00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:13.560
normal,

00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:14.100
acceptable

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.620
practice to

00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:16.460
copy and

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:17.000
paste and say

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:17.540
here's my

00:56:17.540 --> 00:56:18.940
intellectual

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:19.460
contribution.

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:20.100
It's too much

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:20.600
of a crutch

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:21.000
and if,

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.020
you know,

00:56:22.020 --> 00:56:22.400
maybe it

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:23.160
solves 90%

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:23.620
of the problems

00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:24.460
but that 10%

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:24.940
it doesn't,

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:26.120
you're fully

00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:26.940
incapable of

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:27.500
approaching that

00:56:27.500 --> 00:56:27.860
problem,

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:28.140
right?

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:29.160
Exactly,

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:29.540
yeah.

00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:30.580
And I think,

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:30.980
you know,

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:31.500
so if that's

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:32.020
the first part,

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:32.860
what LLMs offer

00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:33.240
us today,

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:33.560
I think the

00:56:33.560 --> 00:56:34.200
second part is

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:34.900
say five to

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:35.380
10 years

00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:36.200
from now.

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:37.600
And part of it

00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:38.020
is scary

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:38.820
and part of it

00:56:38.820 --> 00:56:39.340
is exciting.

00:56:39.340 --> 00:56:40.340
I think that

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:41.900
coding as it

00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:42.760
looks today

00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:43.580
is going to

00:56:43.580 --> 00:56:44.700
largely go away

00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:45.160
over my

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:45.780
lifetime

00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:47.540
because coding

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:48.500
is this mix

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:49.440
of art

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.800
and intellectual

00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:51.280
labor

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:52.280
and manual

00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:52.700
labor.

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:53.920
the manual

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:54.260
labor

00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:54.780
parts,

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:55.520
you know,

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.460
will be

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:56.960
going away

00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:57.340
and that's

00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:57.680
where a lot

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:57.840
of people

00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:58.440
use LLMs

00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:58.880
now to

00:56:58.880 --> 00:56:59.400
reduce

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.020
that grind

00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:01.660
of coding

00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:02.820
and I think

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:03.440
it's important

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.080
for us

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:04.900
to figure out

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:05.780
where those

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:06.500
intellectual

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:07.520
contributions are,

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.100
where the art,

00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:08.640
the poetry

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:09.260
of coding

00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:11.100
remains a

00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.340
human contribution

00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:13.240
moving forward,

00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.540
where we have,

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:14.920
you know,

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:15.360
that sort of

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:15.960
human in the

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.020
loop to make

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:17.960
ethical decisions

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:18.520
that we don't

00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:19.260
pass off,

00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:20.380
where it is

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:20.920
humans who are

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:21.420
doing some of

00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:22.160
the architecting

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:22.540
and not just

00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:23.060
handing it off

00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:23.380
saying,

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:24.500
here's a prompt,

00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:25.300
now redesign

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:25.920
our financial

00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:26.780
system from the

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:27.600
ground up for us,

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:29.080
but that it

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:30.540
remains human

00:57:30.540 --> 00:57:31.480
guardrails and

00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:32.460
human ethics

00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:33.740
and human

00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:34.700
notions of

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:35.660
justice that we

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:37.280
use AI to

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:37.860
help us,

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:38.540
but it doesn't

00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:39.320
replace that.

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.060
Yeah,

00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:40.860
I feel like

00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:41.400
there's going to

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.600
be a lot of

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:42.960
people who are

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:43.600
programmers now

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:44.040
are going to

00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:45.340
have to kind

00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:46.200
of be a senior

00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.240
tech,

00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:48.640
tech team

00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:49.520
lead type of

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:50.400
thing where

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.200
the team is

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:51.880
asking the

00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.640
LLM to do

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:53.240
stuff for you,

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.280
and that's

00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:54.700
going to be

00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:55.360
awesome for

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:55.860
those people,

00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:56.600
us,

00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.200
but for the

00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:58.580
people who are

00:57:58.580 --> 00:57:58.940
brand new,

00:57:58.940 --> 00:57:59.300
there's going to

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:00.200
be a wider

00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:01.120
gap to try to

00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:01.500
cross,

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.260
it's going to

00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:02.740
be harder and

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:03.340
harder to go

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:04.480
from real

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.320
beginner to

00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.260
that level

00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:07.020
when,

00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:08.400
who's going to

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.020
employ you

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:09.860
when it takes

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:10.380
you a day,

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.080
and I can ask

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:12.680
the LLM to do

00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:13.000
it in five

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:13.560
minutes and I

00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.000
got to review

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:14.480
it either way.

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.660
That's a very

00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:17.300
concerning social

00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:17.820
consequence,

00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:18.260
I think.

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:19.400
Exactly.

00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:20.900
Those kind

00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:21.900
of entry

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:22.860
level jobs

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:23.360
are very

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:23.900
much more

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.760
labor focused.

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.480
The senior

00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:28.420
dev isn't

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:29.100
doing that

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:30.900
because someone

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:31.660
with less

00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:32.180
experience,

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:32.840
less pay

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:33.640
can do it,

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.300
and if

00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:36.100
LLMs replace

00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:36.480
that over

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:36.800
time,

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:37.080
it's really

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:37.560
hard to get

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:37.920
your foot in

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:38.180
the door

00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:38.420
of that

00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:38.740
industry.

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:40.000
It's going

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:40.280
to be like

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:41.040
COBOL programmers

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:41.340
did not

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:41.780
a program

00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:42.240
without an

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:42.680
LLM

00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:43.120
someday.

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:46.580
I don't

00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:46.820
know if

00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:47.160
that's good

00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:47.480
or bad,

00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:47.820
but it's

00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:48.140
going to be

00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:48.400
weird.

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.280
Anyway,

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:49.680
I think

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:50.600
it's probably

00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.060
pretty interesting

00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.000
and given

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.340
access with

00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:54.900
your API

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:55.480
and with all

00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:55.840
this data,

00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:56.120
I'm sure

00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:56.440
people will

00:58:56.440 --> 00:58:56.740
be able to

00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:57.580
ask and

00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:57.820
answer

00:58:57.820 --> 00:58:58.220
interesting

00:58:58.220 --> 00:58:58.940
questions with

00:58:58.940 --> 00:58:59.100
it.

00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:00.240
That's the

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:00.480
hope.

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.820
Indeed.

00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:02.200
All right.

00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.560
Two really

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:03.940
quick things

00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:04.340
to close out

00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:04.940
our conversation.

00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:06.060
Roadmap,

00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:07.340
anything on

00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:07.700
the roadmap

00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:08.260
coming real

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:08.620
soon that

00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:09.300
people have

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:09.660
been asking

00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:09.960
about,

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:10.700
thinking about?

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:13.320
I just

00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:13.960
released

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.800
V2.0.

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:19.360
Thank you.

00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.380
That was

00:59:20.380 --> 00:59:21.140
really just

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:22.080
a year

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:23.540
of rethinking

00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:24.480
the API.

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:25.160
I was going

00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:25.360
to allow

00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:25.980
myself breaking

00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:26.520
changes,

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:27.060
really cleaning

00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:27.480
things up.

00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:27.900
I added

00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:29.020
type annotations

00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:30.160
for the first

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:30.520
time.

00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:31.020
I really

00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:31.800
changed the

00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:32.680
linting and

00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:33.400
formatting,

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:33.980
CI,

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:34.580
pre-commit,

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:34.980
everything.

00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:36.340
It's a much

00:59:36.340 --> 00:59:37.040
more rigorous

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.380
package at

00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:38.900
this point.

00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:40.080
I'm taking

00:59:40.080 --> 00:59:40.820
a breather

00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:41.760
right now

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.280
where I

00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:43.720
don't have

00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:44.220
that much

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:44.960
big on

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:45.520
the horizon.

00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:46.780
I try to

00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:47.220
keep a

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:47.900
really clean

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:48.520
issue board

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:48.980
as well where

00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:49.380
I quickly

00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.060
triage.

00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:50.600
This is in

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:50.880
scope,

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.560
this is not.

00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:52.860
I noticed

00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:53.080
you have

00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:53.660
three open

00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:54.240
issues and

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.040
zero PRs,

00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:55.300
which is

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:55.600
awesome.

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.600
I try to

00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:57.800
do it

00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:58.280
courteously.

00:59:58.280 --> 00:59:58.960
I'll tell

00:59:58.960 --> 00:59:59.420
people a lot

00:59:59.420 --> 00:59:59.760
of the time

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.440
this isn't

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:00.700
in scope

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:00.960
for the

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:01.240
project,

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:01.460
but I

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:01.920
appreciate

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.340
the

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:02.800
suggestion.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:03.960
I'm

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:04.240
busy,

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:04.940
so keeping

01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:05.300
a clean

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:05.760
issue board

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.120
makes my

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:06.720
life simple.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.800
Short answer,

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.080
I'm taking

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:09.280
a

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:09.760
breather

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.300
instead of

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:10.940
roadmapping.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:11.500
But you

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:12.640
just had a

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.080
big release,

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:13.400
which is

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:13.600
cool.

01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:14.480
Yeah.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.260
Yeah.

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.560
Contributions

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.020
accepted?

01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:19.860
Absolutely.

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:20.540
And very

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:21.360
often what

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.080
I ask

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:23.340
when someone

01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:23.740
opens an

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:24.060
issue and

01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:24.280
I say,

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:24.460
yeah,

01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:24.800
that does

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.060
sound

01:00:25.060 --> 01:00:25.600
useful.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.040
Would you

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:27.240
like to

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:27.580
open a

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:27.920
PR?

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:30.760
in as

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:31.000
much as

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:31.240
this is

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.040
my side

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:32.400
hustle,

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:32.800
most of

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:33.240
the pull

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:33.620
requests

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.240
that I

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.080
add to

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:35.820
it are

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:36.360
very much

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:37.180
aligned with

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:37.880
a current

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:38.220
or recent

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.040
research project

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:39.380
that I'm

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:39.980
working on.

01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.500
Right.

01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:40.860
So for

01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:41.240
others,

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:41.700
you know,

01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:42.060
if you see

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:43.020
a gap

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:43.700
or a

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.240
cool feature

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:44.580
that could

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:45.160
make people's

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.060
lives easier,

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:47.020
better analytics

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:47.780
down the road,

01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:49.040
please propose

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:49.740
it and I'd

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:49.980
love a

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:50.460
contribution.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:51.960
Excellent.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.580
All right.

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:54.220
Final call to

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:54.400
action.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.080
People are

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.080
psyched about

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:56.420
mapping.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:57.220
They want to

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:57.600
get started.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:57.880
What do you

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.180
tell them?

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:00.640
I tell

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:01.700
them to

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:02.800
work through

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:03.840
existing examples

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:04.420
from the tools

01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:04.940
that are out

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:05.180
there.

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:05.780
If you haven't

01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:06.060
done any

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:06.580
kind of mapping

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.000
before,

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:07.720
there's a lot

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.080
of cool

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:08.880
packages in

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:09.460
R and

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:09.880
Python.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.760
Find

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:11.100
something you're

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:11.360
comfortable

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:11.840
with,

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:12.980
work through

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:13.680
some tutorials

01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:15.020
and then figure

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:15.460
out something

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:16.280
close to home.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.020
It's so much

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.020
easier if you

01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:18.700
have that kind

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.060
of local

01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:19.560
motivation,

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:20.400
local knowledge.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.260
Do some

01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:21.560
mapping,

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:21.820
do an

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:22.460
analysis in

01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.100
your community

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:23.500
for something

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.060
that's bothering

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:25.400
you that you

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:25.740
think could be

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:25.980
better.

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:27.180
Excellent.

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:28.120
All right.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:28.760
Well, thank you

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:29.280
for being here

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.120
and congrats

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:30.540
on the cool

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:30.880
project.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.040
Thank you

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:32.520
very much.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.280
Yep.

01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:33.720
Bye.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.700
Okay.
